- Anchor Christian themes in close reading

> "Because he is unwilling or unable to commit himself to Christ, the
Underground Man is trapped between the world of God and that of human-
ity. The issue bears some resemblance to the notion of limbo in Roman
Catholic theology, the exile suffered by children who die before baptism-
that is, in a state of original sin; it is a kind of "intermediate damnation" (Flath 511)

### II. The Falsity of Literary Confessions












**PERSONAL**
>"In his opinion, Rousseau, for example, undoubtedly lied about himself in his Confessions – even lied deliberately, out of vanity. I’m convinced that Heine is right; I can understand perfectly well how one can sometimes accuse oneself of all sorts of crimes solely out of vanity and I even understand very well the nature of that vanity. But Heine was passing judgement on a man who was making a _public_ confession. But I’m writing for myself alone and declare once and for all that if I’m writing as if I’m addressing readers, then it’s purely for show, since it’s easier writing like that" (Dostoevsky 36).
