| [[Sho-Terra-Nu\|Sho]]   | Shoite    | Creation fragment            | These people believe in creation. While the old magic is seemingly gone, they spend a lot of their time building engineering marvels and architecting cities. These people are builders, blacksmiths, and makers of all the manmade things you see in life. They are hardworking and dedicate their lives to honing their craft.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| [[Sho-Terra-Nu\|Terra]] | Terran    | Earth fragment               | These people believe in absolute harmony with the earth. Many eat a few spoonfuls of dirt every day to become closer to Terra. These people are most often druids, and all are of that general type. They're often very easygoing and at ease in the flow of things, and some people wonder if there's some level of seriousness underneath.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| [[Sho-Terra-Nu\|Nue]]   | Nuite     | False animation fragment     | These people hold the dead very close to them. Outsiders may think they're a bit weird and too worship-y and too close to the dead, but ancestors mean everything to these people- they believe that when you die you become a fragment of Sho-Terra-Nu; A fragment of the original demiurge god, meaning your soul and your remains become embedded in the universe itself.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| [[Revnyris]]            | Nyran     | God of Blood and Glory       | In terms of culture, blood is perfection of the self, and glory is total self fulfillment, at least in the eyes of most Nyrans. They're split into two groups: those who believe in achieving complete perfection of their bodies (they are very fit and spend a lot of time honing physical arts) and those who believe self perfection is attaining vast wealth and practicing as much hedonism as possible. Some are a mix of both, but these people are complete thrill seekers. Many Nyrans also interpret blood in a more literal sense, as they perform eucharistic rituals where they consume the blood of other creatures... the most fanatical ones consume the blood of human sacrifices. |
| [[Eneon]]               | Enite     | God of Time and Hunger       | Enites believe death is the highest possible honor someone can achieve. They live to die a spectacular death. This people are fearless, ruthless, and ready to give up their lives for something they think is worthy, whether that be a bad thing or not. Time may be cruel, but it is loving as it brings you closer to your grand end                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| [[Delenne]]             | Delennite | Light of Art (enlightenment) | Delenne is said to be the bringer of the new magic (dnd magic). People who worship Delenne dedicate their lives to pursuing mastery over new magic, and are always hungry to learn more about the world. No matter how horrific or disgusting something new is, Delennites will often run straight ahead to learn and understand the unknown. Rumors have it that there's a legion of Delennites in Estopoles that steal and obtain information about the kingdom's secrets, pulling the strings from afar.                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| [[Emeial]]              | Emeian    | Light of Luck and Trickery   | Many Emeians are rogues. These people are often very Machiavellian, aspiring to attain wealth and power through often backhanded means. This doesn't mean they can't be loyal, however. But they are ALWAYS plotting something in the greater scheme of things.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Custom                  | Custom    | Light of Custom              | If you aren't too happy with these religions, I'm happy to make a custom minor god with you. We can sort something out.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
