- censors cut big portions of penultimate chapter

>"It would seem Dostoevsky never had the intention of saving the Underground Man in the novel itself..." (Rosenshield 324)

>"His salvation would come-if it did at all-through the acceptance and appreciation of the ideal of compassion and self-sacrifice embodied in the prostitute." (Rosenshield 325)

- Dostoevsky never saves his characters, but instead makes them take the first step in healing

Elements necessary for resurrection
- acknowledgement and acceptance of responsibility
- compassion
- guilt (both conscious and unconscious)
- compulsion to confess
- need to expatiate the committed or contemplated crimes

- ^^^ people fail to recognize these because they are unable to differentiate between the past and present underground man

The future narration hints growth here and there
- part one is straightforward with its narration, but part 2 becomes a bit more all over the place and in this messiness we are given small sections where the underground man gives his thoughts on his beliefs from 16 years ago, and this shows his growth as a character
>"As a result of this narration, a significant ironic distance is established between the underground man's younger and older selves, a distance, moreover, which is underlined by the narrator's numerous statements explicitly explaining the differences between his present and past perceptions of the same events." (Rosenshield 325)

- Underground man acknowledges his decisions are why he's like this, not necessarily his surroundings

Looking back
>""presenting it all as an excuse for a self-indulgent adventure in which the officer was totally unaware of the role in which his younger self had cast him" (Rosenshield 326)
- Underground man seems amused at his experience with the officer
- Presents himself as directly responsible for his humiliation at Zverkov's party
	- Partially depicts himself as a victim but he always knows what he's doing

#### Liza
>"I had already sensed for quite some time that I had turned her whole soul upside down and I had wrung her heart and the more I became convinced of this, the more I wanted to attain my end as quickly and as forcefully as possible." (Dostoevsky ??)
- ^^ Just like the other sections he is self aware that he is doing something bad, but this time he goes even further to say that humiliating Liza would even be pleasurable to him

- In this section the underground man becomes much more of an aggressor as his inner need for love and community drives him to attemptedly lash out repeatedly at Liza. **He is the aggressor because he is hurting others more than he is hurting himself, here.**

SELF QUOTE - On Liza leaving the money behind. Ripe with indications of growth and maturity!
>Might have expected? No. I was such an egotist and in actual fact had so little respect for others that I couldn't imagine that she would do such a thing." (Dostoevsky 115)

116 paragraph 2
- He knowingly is trying to hurt Liza and he does take full responsibility
- The word fantasy implies he knows better now, or at least that it was an unrealistic thought

>"However lost and confused he appears to himself, he is presented by the implied author as being closer to seeing the light now than he was before, and closer even than those who have continued to live lives based on abstractions and have remained completely unaware that they have done so." (Rosenshield 328)

#### Responsibility
- Underground man says that for responsibility to be meaningful there must be free will,
>"He must 'prove' that free will exists in order to feel comfortable with his 'irrational' acceptance of responsibility for his past behaviour." (Rosenshield 328)

#### Compassion - just as important as acceptance of responsibility
>"My heart simply ached from pity for her awkwardness and unnecessary candor, but immediately something ugly suppressed all pity in me, it egged me on even more." (Dostoevsky ??)
- Important note that his pity is self induced from the stories he projects onto Liza
- Narrator presents himself as a predator and Liza as prey to illicit compassion for her

#### Guilt - the most important
>"I could not make out what was wrong with me, I could not find the clue, something seemed to be rising up continually in my soul, painfully, and refusing to be appeased. I returned home completely upset; it was just as through some crime was lying on my conscience" (Dostoevsky ??)
- Younger Underground Man is confused by his feeling of guilt, thinking it's about Zverkov, but instead it's really about his cruelty to Liza. The future narrator has had more time to think over his feelings and is able to better explain what his past self could not.
>"But I did not know then that fifteen years later I should still in imagination see Liza, with the same pitiful, distorted, inappropriate smile which was on her face at that minute" (Dostoevsky ??).

>"Even now, after so many years, it is almost too painful to recall all this. In fact, there is a great deal now which is painful for me to recall, but... isn't it about time that I put an end to these Notes? It seems to me that I made a mistake in beginning them. At least, I have been ashamed all the time I have been writing this tale: it must be then that this is not really literature, but corrective punishment." (Dostoevsky ??)

**PATTERN ACROSS BOOKS**
>Notes from Underground, Like most of Dostoevsky's works, is in essence a novel about crime and corrective punishment, and it is from the crime itself that the forces arise which lead the criminal to atonement- and the chance for regeneration that perhaps could not have been possible before it occurred" (Rosenshield 331)

**THE NOTES ARE A CONFESSION**
>"The older Underground Man writes a confession, as it were, out of physical necessity and he goes on writing because he cannot stop but he does not know- he cannot know- that this writing is in itself an essential first step out of the underground" (Rosenshield 332)

**ROSSEAU'S CONFESSIONS**
- As a child, he falsely accused a girl of stealing a hat and it messed up her life probably. He felt bad and said a sorry-not-sorry and it makes for a weak confession. Underground Man takes full responsibility for what he did, and reducing his crimes to being just a product of his misery is something he does not do.

**DEFINITION OF CONFESSION**
>The acknowledgment and acceptance of responsibility; compassion; guilt (both conscious and unconscious); the compulsion to confess; and the need to expiate the crimes contemplated or committed" (Rosenshield 325).
