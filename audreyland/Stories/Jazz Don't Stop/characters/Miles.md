# Miles Dean
*the pianist*

A control freak perfectionist who always wants to achieve a specific sound. He arranges all the songs and constantly blows up on people when they don't play them his way. **He was in a really important state wide band but got thrown out because of his anger issues.** He's constantly getting up people's asses because he wants to make them meet his standards.

Let's say he came from a family of jazzheads so there's this huge expectation on him to succeed and be good at jazz. The others liked him because he's very loyal and caring deep down but getting booted from the band really fucked with him.
