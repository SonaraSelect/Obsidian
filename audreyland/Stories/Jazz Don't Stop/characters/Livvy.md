# Olivia Delaney
*the bassist*

She says she's playing jazz for the friends and good times, but in actuality she's playing because it's being forced to. Her father is super hard on her and he insists that she be the top of her class and play an instrument. He's a bit disappointed that she didn't want to play any classical, but this is about enough leeway for her.

She tries to take the edge off through her relationships with people, and is always trying to find safety in someone else from all these aggressive critics around her. She's thoughtful and also very good at getting people to open up (maybe Simon's first conversation about how he's so lonely will be with her) and maybe she falls for Miles eventually because of his warm side.

I think that, unfortunately, as things move on and if Miles never changes, the best move for her will be to leave the combo. There won't be a happy ending until she ends up going against the grain; Against Miles' and her father's harsh standards so she can really embrace her own self.
