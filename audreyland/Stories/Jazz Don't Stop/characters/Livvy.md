# Olivia ????
*the bassist*

She says she's playing jazz for the friends and good times, but in actuality she's playing because it's being forced onto her and she is too afraid/unwilling to say no. Her father is super hard on her and desperate to make her be good at something, and jazz is one of those things, especially since she struggles in school.

She tries to take the edge off through her relationships with people, and is always trying to find safety in someone else from all these aggressive critics around her. She's thoughtful and very good at getting people to open up (maybe Simon's first conversation about how he's so lonely will be with her) and maybe in a weird way she falls for Miles eventually because of his warm side.

I think that, unfortunately, as things move on and if Miles never changes, the best move for her will be to leave the band. There won't be a happy ending until she ends up going against the grain; Against Miles' and her father's harsh standards so she can really embrace her own self.


Describing Grace:
A very nice girl. She's a little withdrawn, but she's really good at getting super close with people, and she's even better at holding really insightful conversations too. She's very emotionally intelligent and may have a lot of good advice, but only when she isn't busy thinking about her self.

She has an issue with loud critics, like her father, and she always tries her best to make it look like she isn't being bothered by it all, but she always holds onto it until the point where she snaps and causes lasting damage.
