# Wyatt ????
*the drummer*

Wyatt's playing jazz to escape his problems by goofing around with people and getting competent at something. He's really hyper and gets into conflict with Miles a lot. He gets distracted during rehearsals (especially the important ones) but is always the life of the party and the secret glue that holds everyone together.

He's never serious, he's always there when the group members need to vent to someone (maaybe not Miles, I see him talking to Simon the most), and he is really skilled at what he does and even plays a bit of everyone else's instrument... but since he is the drummer, I don't see him getting the chance to fill in for anyone at any time.


## Relationships

[[Livvy]] - 

[[Miles]] - 

[[Simon]] - On very good terms with him. Wyatt is always the one getting him out of his shell and pushing him to express himself and get closer to the others. Besides this group that Wyatt introduced him to, Wyatt is his only close friend.
