# Simon Rayner
*the trumpeter*

He plays jazz because it's what he knows best... and he hates things he doesn't know very well. Simon has listened to a LOT of music, and he's VERY well practiced. But he never goes out to play, the community barely knows him, and even in his playing he's so used to backtracks that he just ends up flexing his technique and never leaving breaks for the rhythm section to fill in.

He's apprehensive and non confrontational, but he's also very sweet and caring. When people show him enough vulnerability he slowly brings his walls down and he can finally connect with people- something he so desperately wants to do but still struggles with. He wouldn't be playing with and getting to know the others if it weren't for his only close friend, Wyatt.
