I want to write a story about some kids playing jazz !! I want to model it off of some of my personal experiences with jazz and general high school!!

The kids will have some interpersonal struggles; There's a huge focus here on their relationships with each other. Maybe some really complicated love triangles, or at least a thing going on between James, Livvy, and Simon.

To each of them, jazz is their hope. Their optimism, their joy, their release. But they aren't actualized enough to hold this optimism together all the time, and the story is about them overcoming their problems with one another to perform jazz to the best of their ability!

## Brainstorming themes, arcs, plot

\>> Maybe the story starts with how the gang gets together?


**Any** possible themes

- Relationships with difficult fathers
- Absence of fathers
- Love (please get more specific)
- >> Friendship <<

I was thinking about conflict around

- How they approach jazz and why they approach it that way

Like how [[Miles]] is really perfectionistic and gets mad at everyone. [[Wyatt]] is all over the place and is too casual and dismissive of issues and puts them off. [[Simon]] is too in his own head and doesnt interact as much with the others, his playing gets selfish even. And [[Livvy]]... uhh... I havent thought much about her relationship to the horn

- The gang sneaks out to go to jazz bars, and Wyatt gets addicted to Kratom.
- Livvy falls for Miles, then Simon falls for Livvy, then the Grace situation ensues
- Miles' need for the group to conform exactly to his standards

Similarities between characters:

- Simon and Wyatt both ignore the world and stick without realms that make them feel comfortable
- 

## Characters

- [[Miles]] - *the pianist*. SX1. An angry perfectionistic character obsessed with correcting others and achieving his specific, grand vision
- [[Livvy]] - *the bassist*. SO4. A self defeating character who's always starting drama and becoming the victim, always forcing people to take sides.
- [[Simon]] - *the trumpeter*. SX5. Pretty casual guy who's sort of timid and worried about trying to get himself out there. He works hard, yes, but he stays within his own personal world a good bit and thus he's a bit estranged from others
- [[Wyatt]] - *the drummer*. SX7. Super hyper guy who's kind of always disrupting practice. Hey, why not he dabbles in like every other instrument, too. He has a tragic backstory he's always escaping from, and this is what drives him to be so manic.

## Moments I want to model

Okay... this one is a bit harder to approach honestly. I'll have to spend some time journaling over this one ngl.

- Noah's explosions and meltdowns over things.
- Grace's heavy self victimizations and polarizations of the group
- Shaun's fear of getting out into the real world
- My lack of focus and its sabotage of my loyalty to skills

These are all kind of character based tho... I feel like I want something that 

WAAAAITT !!! **What if I model something about the insane romance of my old group.** Maybe [[Livvy]] ends up having a fling thing with [[Miles]] just like Grace-Noah, but then [[Simon]] is also really into her and stuff so it's a complicated triangle. In order to make it through the competition, they'll have to overcome their differences

\>> Omg I just thought of a scene where the combo is playing and James and Livvy go completely out of sync and they just make mean faces at each other, meanwhile Wyatt starts to go a bit crazy and Simon gets lost and doesn't know what to do!! aaah its gonna be peak !!
## People I want to model

- Noah's rage and perfectionism, the tricky relationship with him being vital to the team and somewhat nice but also so critical of people messing around when they don't follow the vision he wants (I will project all his minecraft rage into jazz, make him a really good jazz pianist)

- Maybe something to do with Grace, I like this sort of tragic self-defeating character who's constantly trying to suffer in silence before snapping and constantly damaging relationships because they couldn't assert themselves before they reached their breaking point

- I feel like I have to model at least some character off of Chris. But he was such a chill guy! He might make for a nice main character honestly, he's a standard guy who practices jazz a lot and sticks to his own things. Maybe I could write a more withdrawn person who sticks to the gym and jazz, and will grow by going out to interact more with the world?

- Lastly I feel like I should base a character off myself. Make them super sx7. Make them really ambitious, really all over the place, and insanely innately gifted. But they are constantly running from pain, have a super tragic backstory (I have some idea of parent gets critically injured in a car crash, or some sort of sudden absence of parent), and this drives them to only be more manic going on
