While finally quoting a line from Bill Evans to finish my piano solo, I looked up at Simon. He was staring at the ground again.  I cleared my thought, right on queue with my final note, and he sprung into action with a jump, slamming his trumpet against his lips and started with a note that sounded more like a fart than music.

I was too focused on the music at that time, but I will say what I would've thought, had I had the mental space to: I am sick of him slacking. I have never met a more promising player within Jazz in my life, and yet here one is. I spent all my time working on my playing- I've been playing since I was three! Yet he's still better than me, but somehow with the slightest amount of pressure he falls apart. And in some weird way as much as I hate his playing, what I hate more than anything is the way he is better than the rest of the band all while not even trying to show it. I've never seen him try! He always stares at the ground and seemingly pretends to be inept. I hate him for it.

As I continued to play background over his solo, his eyes would slowly move to the ground and he would start playing at the tempo of a different song entirely. Staring at the ground was his queue.

"Relax." I commanded, watching his head bob right back up as his playing returned to a normal tempo.

I continued to play as softly as I could- Simon commanded a lot of space with his trumpet, he would constantly run across the upper and lower bounds of his horn, all while leaving very little time to breathe, which meant very little time for me to fill in an empty spot with a line or two. Slowing down and leaving open spaces was the point of today's one on one.

Simon's head began to lower again.

"Simon!" I cried, my fingers almost clenching above the keyboard. My tightened fingers could barely push down the keys and this new ineptitude only bothered me more an more. Then after some more noodling, Simon lowered his head.

That was enough. Seeing red, I yanked my binder off the piano and threw it right into Simon's stomach. He yelped into the horn, making the same fart-like trumpet sound just like he did when he started playing.

"You always do this!" I screamed. "You never slow down. You just keep playing and playing and playing. Do you think you can just noodle the whole time? Off tempo!? I tell you to take breaks and let the rhythm section fill in, but you never do!"

A strained frown was seeping into Simon's face. He was trying not to react, I could see it. And the reluctance to own up to anything- just like always- only made me madder. He stuttered something I couldn't hear.

"What have I been telling you, Simon? This whole time. You need. to slow. down. And you need to leave some gaps in your playing god damnit! I start to think you don't even pay any attention into your playing. Do you know how disappointing you are?" I barked. I smothered my palm against my forehead. How many times have we been over this, I thought. "This isn't just about you, okay? Jazz is about communication, and you have to listen if you're going to speak... I know you think you can just come here and be the star of the show because you're the only horn in the band, but every time I hear you play you only get more pretentious!"
