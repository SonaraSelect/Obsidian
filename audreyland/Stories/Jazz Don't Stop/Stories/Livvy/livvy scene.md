Before opening the door, Simon paused. He could hear the occasional muffled slapping of a bass emanating through it. A confused look flashed on his face. *What would she be doing here so late?* Slowly he turned the knob and opened the door to the dimly lit band room. As he walked towards the sounds, the playing stopped. There she was, her back towards him, sitting on a chair with her head bowed over her bass underneath the only light in the room.

"Livvy?" Simon said.

Livvy jumped in her seat. Before turning around, she wiped her face.

"Hey, Simon! You scared me!" She said with a laugh. "You here to pick up your trumpet?"

"Yeah," Simon said. The music stand in front of Livvy was full of scattered sheet music. Papers placed on top of one another, some flipped onto their sides, some at an angle slowly falling out of the folder beneath. During practice she would always keep her music so clean. "What are you doing here? It's late."

"Oh I'm just practicing," Livvy said, turning to glance at the big amp by her feet. "I lent my amp to a friend for the week, so I'm here. I like to really hear what I'm playing, anyways." She smiled at him, though it seemed a bit forced.

"Are you good, Livvy? You seem a little out of it."

"I'm just a bit tired- it's been a long day. I wouldn't worry about it."

"Gotcha." Simon said. He turned to pick up his trumpet from the closet. After moving around a few objects in the room, he reappeared and walked towards the door.

"Simon," Livvy said, "what did you think of my solo yesterday?"

Simon stopped.

"Uh. Which one?"

"The one that Miles got so upset over."

"Oh." He paused. "I thought that one was really good. Probably my favorite from the session." Simon turned to her and put his trumpet case down. ""
