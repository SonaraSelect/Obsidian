Simon stuffed the last bite of his meatball sandwich into his mouth, and he took a moment to savor the moment. The late spring air was warm, but just comfortable enough to take his sweatshirt off, and the atmosphere was filled with the sound of cars driving by and the chatter of people walking by on the street next to the restaurant's outdoor seating.

"Hey, Simon... right?" said a girl's voice.

A look of confusion flashed on Simon's face as he turned around.

"Olivia."

This was the the first time he spoke to her: the girl who was invited his jazz combo by the pianist. He had seen her before, playing some funk with a different band at a bar the previous week. Back then she had seemed so confident and in tune with her instrument. She was dancing, jumping up and down, bobbing her head to the music with her red hair flying around her face. But the type of music she had played then was incompatible with Simon's vision for his jazz combo, despite what the pianist said about her skills.

"Hi," Olivia smiled, unable to contain a slight wince at Simon's coldness, "you're in the combo with Miles, right?"
