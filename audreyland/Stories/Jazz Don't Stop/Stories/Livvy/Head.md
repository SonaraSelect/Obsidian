Alright, so I think it's about time that we write a flash fiction scene for Livvy. 

I could do
- Introduction of Livvy, her first audition
- Chaos scene with all the characters
- Livvy's vulnerability and turning point in her arc (the midpoint!)
- Some sort of conversation before or after a performance with Livvy and others

Checking in on the character arcs:
Miles, Livvy, and Simon all get one.

### Miles
I want him to learn to be less critical and more appreciative of the music he's making with people. He constantly holds himself to such a high standard and it really sabotages him from a lot of happiness to be had within something as beautiful as music. He will become less perfectionistic and controlling, lessening the harsh standards he puts on himself and others. Being more accepting of himself will be especially helpful in accepting the others' flaws
- from Livvy:
- from Simon: In the first one Simon shows him how

### Livvy
I want her to start being more real and candid. To put down the mask and let herself be "ugly" with the people she's close to.
