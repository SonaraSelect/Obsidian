My fingers bobbed up and down along my trumpet valves as I played, but my mind was stuck somewhere between the notes. I kept trying to play the same phrase over and over again, but I wouldn't stop messing up as I sped up and slowed down. With each failure, Miles, hunched over the piano, interrupted his focused stare at his instrument to glance at me with an annoyed look, but each time I kept trying.

He started to seem increasingly ticked off, and with each glare I would shift my weight to the other foot and shy my eyes away from him, counting the seats of the empty auditorium. The audience seating was very dim as only the stage lights were on, and a few seats were stuck folded open. I liked the emptiness. *No one to judge me.*

Thwack!

I yelped into the trumpet as a binder slammed into my side. Behind a explosion of sheet music falling through the air, Miles stood up from behind the piano, his face fuming.

"Are you serious, Simon!?" He cried, his voice reverberating across the auditorium. "You always do this. You never pay any attention! And you keep falling off tempo. What have we been working on all this time? Do you even remember the goal of today's session?"

"...call and response." I muttered, rubbing my side.

"And are you giving me a chance to respond?"

"No..."

My ears were burning. I looked to the vacant rows for anyone who could make this end sooner.

"So now what. I just don't know what else you want me to do, Simon. I do so much for you all, and what do you do? You ruined the last competition with how you played over everyone's solos- even the final head of the song! Do you seriously think it's all about you? Your playing isn't even good. It isn't! At least not right now. You're not taking a single break for me to fill in. Instead you just blow a never ending stream of show off slop into your horn at the wrong tempo. Where's the two way communication? At that point you're not even playing jazz anymore." Miles yelled. He put his palm to his face and sighed. His slicked back hair didn't move an inch as he shook his head. "I don't know what to do with you at this point. When we first started working together you became the best player in the band. What happened!? When did you start getting so sloppy. You barely even try. Now, every time we play you tell me I spent all that time with you for nothing. Simon, we have a competition next week."

I stared at him. The binder lay by my feet like a corpse. Eventually, I nodded. "Miles, I'm sorr-"

"Sorry won't cut it, Simon! It's been three weeks of this and you haven't changed one bit." Miles said. "If we don't get platinum this time it'll be all your fault. Do better"

"Maybe I can't, Miles." I cried. "I don't know what I'm supposed to do. I'm trying to focus but I just can't think."

"Well what do you want me to tell you!? You're supposed to stay in time, are you even counting the beats in your head? With your foot?"

"...you're not helping." I said.

"Yes I am! Who's hosting these practice sessions with you so often. Who's writing all your songs? Who's sending you new exercises every week? I do all this just for you to ruin everything. I can't take your shit anymore."

Miles stomped towards me. 

"You're never gonna make it like this." 

Taking two steps back, I tripped against the chair behind me and fell down alongside my trumpet. The silver horn clattered against the ground.

Without batting an eye, Miles stormed past me to the exit door across the stage.

"Your fault." He said.

I tried to speak but my sentence couldn't form.

"I quit!" I called after him, but the door had already slammed shut. I was left behind in the dim light with my voice's dying echo.

I sat on the ground, sniffling while staring at the audience of ghosts, all judging me. *I really did ruin that competition for everyone... Maybe performing isn't for me.*

Clearing my throat, I slowly rose from the cold floor and picked up Miles' binder. I dragged myself to the piano and collected the scattered papers from the brown plywood floor and sorted them into the binder. After leaving the binder where it belonged on the piano, I trudged back to my instrument laying on the ground. The trumpet's bell had a huge dent.  

***

Since Mile's tirade I became a no-show to our rehearsals, and I never messaged anyone about my leave. Wyatt, the drummer, probably told them on my behalf. 

A week passed by, and it was the day of the competition. I stayed home. As usual, I was spending my time playing along with my collection of jazz records in the unfinished basement. The place looked ridiculous, really. One wall had a wooden beadboard pattern while the rest were drywall. One was painted yellow, another pink. The air was musty and topped the room off with a dirty, poorly maintained feeling.

I blasted one *Giant Steps* on the record player over and over again and played along. It was insanely fast and technical, but it was my dream to play the song like Coltrane did. I had been coming close, but every few lines I would stumble and fall. After maybe 3 hours of failing over and over again, and I set the trumpet down as frustration took over my body. *Maybe Miles was right.*

My phone rang. It was Wyatt.

"Hello?" I said.

"Hey, well look who it is! The mad trumpeter finally picks up." Wyatt said, laughing. "We missed you today! I hope you know that."

"Thanks."

"I mean it. The band wasn't the same without you. I felt like Miles doesn't know what to do now that you're not playing over him!" Wyatt chuckled. He always pushed it a little with his jokes. "Well, at least I like to think so. He's been a bit more quiet. He hasn't been putting his whole heart into the band since you left, and all... Anyways. You wanna play out sometime?"

I stared at the dent on my trumpet.

"Does my playing bother you?" I asked.

"What?"

"My playing. I've been trying to play faster lines lately but it just hasn't been working out. I really want to, though, but then I just start to think about the last competition," I said. "I'm trying so hard to make it work but it never does. I just want to know, because maybe I *should* stop if it's bothering everybody else. I don't want to ruin things for you guys. I'm so sorry for last competition. I hope things went better today... I bet they did."

"We got gold."

"What?"

"Yup. Same as last time. Maybe we're cursed. Or maybe we needed you. I was serious when I said the band's not the same without you."

"But-"

"Hey, I bet your whole extended solo wasn't a big part of it, either. Last time our bassist and I weren't fully in sync and we didn't do much with dynamics. We just played loud the whole time. It was our problem again- they mentioned it in the workshop today, too. And beyond that, your playing was insane! Regardless of how long you played, you were completely locked in and I had never seen you play that fast, like ever," Wyatt said, pausing. "And remember after that, too? You were glowing. You even said that everything finally clicked with jazz and that you're sure you want to do it for the rest of your life. You were so bubbly during the lunch break, not like your usual stiffness. Give yourself some credit."

"I guess..."

"Don't forget it. So I gotta ask again: You down to play out? I found a new place."

"I don't know... I've been practicing, but my playing is still such a mess."

"Hey now, don't give me that crap," Wyatt laughed, "this is jazz we're talking about- it's *about* being messy. You don't have to be perfect. I know what Miles says, and sometimes he has a point, but not always. Just know I enjoy playing with you regardless. See you tomorrow?" 

I looked at the walls, pink next to yellow, and both were starting to tear at the top. It was such an awful mix of colors. And the basement really did smell musty. *I couldn't stay here forever.*

"Alright. Just this once."

I picked up my trumpet to try practicing once again.

The cool summer air felt refreshing in my lungs. It was only just now starting to cool down. I watched my mom's minivan leave the small parking lot to disappear behind a building as she drove down the street. The bar was small despite having its own parking lot: there was a short path to the two glass doors and a big "The Wrong Note" sign above. My trumpet bobbed on my back as I walked to the door.

I raised my hand to open the door, but I froze right at the handlebars. My palms began to feel sweaty. A block of ice was forming in my chest, and I decided to sit down by the grass to take a breather before I entered. I wanted to give my best, after all, so I set down my trumpet case and lowered my self onto the grass. It felt cool under my palms, and I closed my eyes to catch my breaths as I began to think. *This all really started to falling apart after he tore into me for playing over everyone, back then... But, still, could I ever play like that again?*

"Simon?" said a confused voice ahead of me.

 I jumped. It was Miles, standing by the edge of the entrance pathway with a strange look on his face.

"I thought you stopped playing." Miles said, looking down at me.

"I-"

"I don't wanna hear it. It was stupid of you to try quitting in the first place. And to just skip the competition without saying anything? Seriously? Half of the songs we planned on playing needed a horn. We didn't do well, and it was just because you ditched us. You are *this* close to playing good, you know that? But you're always being so stubborn."

"Miles, I'm sorry," I said. "It was too much for me... I didn't mean to ruin things. I've been practicing trying to fix things, but I couldn't get it working in time..."

"Yeah. You're stuck because you're playing on your own. I could help you, but you reject that," Miles said. "Do you know how far you've come since we started practicing together? You started out as the worst player in the band and then we turned you into the best. Do you know how much harder most people have to work to get to where you're at?" A strained look grew on his face. "And you just try to toss that away. If I were you, a version that actually takes the time to have patience with my phrasing, I would be out there playing in front of people every night. Probably making some good money off of it too. Do better."

"Maybe you're right." I said, taking a deep breath. "But honestly, I don't think I can listen to you any longer. Sure, you helped show me how to practice, and you stuck with me as I plateaued and as I got better. But..." I picked up my case and got on my feet, my eyes now on the same level as Miles, "why do you have to hate my playing so much? It gets stuck in my head. Maybe playing fast doesn't mean I'm playing wrong. It's not my fault you can't play any faster!"

Miles' face went sour. "Oh you think I can't play fast? Get inside. Right now. We're playing Giant Steps. Let's see who's fault it is when you mess up."

***

The stage light was just bright enough to almost be blinding, and the place was a bit cramped. The ceiling was low, and there was a sea of tables and chairs packed together right in front of the stage. Most of the seats were filled, and the air was filled with the sounds of glasses clinking and people chatting. One man by the bar was laughing especially loudly.

Miles walked up to the mic.

"Alright. Here's Giant Steps."

A few people clapped, one man cheered. As Miles sat down at the piano, he shot me a daring glance. He gave the band a nod and counted us off under his breath.

"One. Two. One two three four."

The room exploded with sound as we all barreled in straight into the music. Wyatt's hand was bouncing over the ride cymbal and the bassist's whole body was shaking as she strummed each quarter note. I straightened my back as I blew a steady stream of air from my stomach into my horn, while Miles' hands, synchronized with me, jumped left and right on the piano.

It was going great, but the head of the song was the easiest part. My solo was next, and I was trying to think of what to play. Wyatt was driving the sound so quickly on the ride.

Before I knew it, Miles had fallen into the backdrop and it was already my turn to improvise. I started with a run up my trumpet but I faltered at the end. A man in the crowd winced. *Shit.*

I tried playing a run down the trumpet, then in a new register, then the first run I originally tried. Nothing was working. The song changed key every measure, and at this speed, every key change felt jumping from cliff to cliff. I was trying to make the long jumps, but my legs were starting to give up. With the stage lights I felt like a deer staring down a car's headlights.

It felt as if the song was getting faster, and no matter what I did, I couldn't keep up. Giving my fingers a break, I took a moment to breathe. Miles shot me a glare that said "watch this."

He butt in on the piano before I could continue playing His playing was slightly shaky and slow, but it was steady. His left foot was jumping up and down counting every other beat and his eyes were honed in on the keys. He started playing a line that I had tried to play, but messed up the ending.

*I can't lose this easily.*

I played a single high note over him and I repeated it. I left space, then played it again with a different rhythm.

Miles glared at me before snapping back to the keys. *I'll need something more to take the attention back.* 

I played as hard as I could. *I can't give up yet*. But, to be frank, I sounded awful. None of it was in time. My grip on the trumpet tightened and my face strained. *I won't let him take this from me.* I moved my fingers up and down my trumpet valves, almost seemingly playing notes at random. Miles cringed. A man in the crowd frowned.

I had fallen behind and I couldn't remember where in the song we were. I tried playing a few lines but every note I tried happened to be in the wrong key.

Refusing to contribute any more to my mess, Miles stopped and signaled the band to cut off. But Wyatt still went on, pounding the beat forward with his drums. I turned to him behind me, and he was drenched with sweat. "Go on!" he mouthed.

I took a deep breath and steadied my hands. With no one else playing the chords, I could start wherever I pleased, and that was exactly what I did. I could focus directly on Wyatt's playing, too. He was bouncing left and right on the snare with a heavy triplet feel, but that wouldn't throw me off.

I listened closely to his rhythm and repeated it on my horn. I left a space and he filled it. 

*I've got it in me.*

It started to work. Soon, I began to move in whichever direction I wanted to go, and Wyatt would push me there with the beat. I made it across every jump between keys, and each time he slammed the ride to celebrate me sticking the landing.

In fact, I wasn't just jumping around anymore. I was soaring. I simply thought of the music and my body did all the work. I thought about the competition, and Miles, and everything he said. And the times he's helped me; the good he's done. But it was up to me to decide what I wanted to do with what he gave me, not him. *This*, was what I wanted- not his vision for me.

Soon I was finished with all the ideas I had to play, and I signaled to Miles it was time to play the head one last time. Everyone came in on time and we wrapped up the song, and I finished with a smooth cadenza to top things off. The audience clapped and cheered as I stood there, still catching my breath in disbelief as I wiped the sweat off my forehead.

Miles stood up from the piano. He turned to me with a slightly pained look on his face. He looked at the piano, then my trumpet, then me. Despite his look, a slight smile formed on his lips. He looked me in the eyes, gave me a nod.
