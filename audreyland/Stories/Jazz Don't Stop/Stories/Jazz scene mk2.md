Miles turned to me with a nod. It was my turn to play. I entered the jazz ballad with a smooth high note on my trumpet, picking up right where he left off at the end of his piano solo. I began to play slow, but I couldn't keep my focus. While my fingers started to move quickly from the muscle memory of my fast exercises, I thought about how I was going to tell him.

I was grateful for our band- the jazz combo with the 4 of us. This was the first time anyone else had ever invited me to do something outside of school. In fact, Miles had invited me first when he started the jazz combo earlier this month. I'll never forget our first practice session at Miles' house, I stood at the door too afraid to knock for 20 minutes. I would've gone home if my mom who dropped me off didn't leave, and before I could finally knock one of the other band members saw me through the window.

"Relax." Miles said with a stern tone over his piano playing.

Right. I nodded back, calmed my fingers down, and tried to play slowly and softly... I need to focus if I don't want to start playing fast again. Like I always do when I get nervous. I almost blew it when our band played at our first competition last week. I got too nervous and I played the wrong high notes- a common mistake *for beginners*- and I started to play fast and off tempo. We tied first place, and it might've been all my fault. Miles never let go of it.

"Simon!" Miles cried, still playing the jazz ballad slow and sweetly, a strange contrast to his tone and increasingly agitated expression.

After flinching, I slowed down my speed yet again. Slow and steady. Not fast. I need to stop doing fast. But I haven't been able to yet, and that's my problem. Miles worked so hard, he was so dedicated to the band. He arranged all our songs- the judges loved his original tune- and he always held one on one practices with everyone to fine tune their skills. He's much more dedicated than me... I don't fit in...

Thwack!

A binder slammed into my side and I yelped into my trumpet. An explosion of paper floated to the ground by the piano, and behind the falling cloud I saw Miles' face, fuming, as he glared at me.

"You always do this!" he cried. "I keep telling you to play less lines. To play slow. To take more breaks and let the rhythm section fill in, but you never do!"

"I just-," I stuttered. "I'm sorr-."

"What have I been telling you, Simon? This whole time. You need. to. slow. down. And you need to leave gaps in your playing for the rhythm section to fill in. Are you even paying attention to your playing? This isn't just about you, okay? Jazz is about communication, and you have to listen if you're going to speak. I know you think you can just come here and be the star of the show because you're the only horn in the band, but every time I hear you play you only get more pretentious!" Miles yelled. He dug his face in his right palm, sighing, but before I could speak up he continued. "You're always late, Simon. To practice. Almost every time! And sure. Sure. You can play well. I know you spend all day and night running arpeggios and enclosure exercises until your fingers bleed, but do we seriously have to hear 'oh I can play really fast up and down my instrument' all the damn time? You need to calm down!"

"Miles, really. I'm trying-"

"Well if you really were you'd stop." Miles snorted.

"I just... Miles.. Look maybe I just can't! I can't!"

Miles sneered.

"I don't know if I can do better. I'm trying so hard but every time it's all the same!" I screamed. A heavy feeling entered my chest. "I'm just not cut out enough like the rest of you. I'm not put together like you. I'm not strong like you. All I can do is falter my notes and run scales." I paused, noticing a wet streak fall down my cheek. My throat was burning, but I had to choke through a few more words. "I can't do this anymore Miles. I'm not cut out for it. I quit the band!"

I turned away and picked up my case, throwing my trumpet inside, zipping it shut as I ran to the exit door.

"Do you really wanna give up that easily, Simon?" Miles' voice echoed as the door slammed shut behind me.

After that I cried under the stairs. It hadn't been the first time that dark corner saw me like this. I sat there too long to remember, wondering why I couldn't be like him. Jazz was all I had, really. My grades were mediocre, I wasn't good at sports, nor was I good at meeting people and making friends. But the trumpet was always there for me.

I didn't see Miles for a month after that
