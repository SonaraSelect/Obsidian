Miles turned to me with a nod. It was my turn to play. I entered the jazz ballad with a smooth high note on my trumpet, picking up right from the end of his piano solo. I began to play slow, but I couldn't keep my focus. My thoughts started to wander, and my fingers started to speed up.

I was grateful for our band- the jazz combo with the 4 of us. My first invite to anything was from Miles. when he had invited me first when he started the jazz combo earlier this month. On our first practice session at his house, I stood at the door too afraid to knock for 20 minutes. And before I could finally knock, Wyatt, the drummer, saw me through the window and cheerfully let me in.

"Relax." Miles said with a stern tone over his piano playing.

Right. I nodded back. I slowed my fingers down. If I don't focus I might start playing fast again. Like every time I get nervous. I almost blew it when our band played at our first competition last week. I played the wrong high notes- a common mistake *for beginners*- and I played fast and off tempo. We tied first place, and it might've been all my fault. Miles never let go of it.

"Simon!" Miles cried, still playing the jazz ballad slow and sweetly.

After flinching, I slowed down my speed yet again. Slow and steady. Not fast. I need to stop playing fast. But I haven't been able to yet, and that's my problem. Miles worked so hard, he was so dedicated to the band. He arranged all our songs and he always held one on one practices with everyone to fine tune their skills. He's much more dedicated than me... I don't fit in...

Thwack!

A binder slammed into my side and I yelped into my trumpet. An explosion of paper floated to the ground by the piano, and behind the falling cloud I saw Miles' face, fuming, as he glared at me.

"You always do this!" he cried. "I keep telling you to play less lines. To play slow. To take more breaks and let the rhythm section fill in, but you never do!"

"I just-," I stuttered. "I'm sorr-."

"What have I been telling you, Simon? This whole time. You need. to. slow. down. And you need to leave gaps in your playing for the rhythm section to fill in. Are you even paying attention to your playing? This isn't just about you, okay? Jazz is about communication, and you have to listen if you're going to speak. I know you think you can just come here and be the star of the show because you're the only horn in the band, but every time I hear you play you only get more pretentious!" Miles yelled. He dug his face in his right palm. "You're always late, Simon. To practice. Almost every time! And sure. Sure. You can play well. I know you spend all day and night running arpeggios and enclosure exercises until your fingers bleed, but do we seriously have to hear 'oh I can play really fast up and down my instrument' all the damn time? You need to calm down!"

"Miles, really. I'm trying-"

"Well if you really were you'd stop." Miles snorted.

"I just... Miles.. Look maybe I just can't! I can't!"

Miles sneered.

"I try to do better but I'm the same every time!" I screamed. "I'm just not cut out enough like the rest of you. I'm not put together like you. My dedication doesn't show like you. All I do is falter my notes and run scales." I paused, noticing a wet streak fall down my cheek. My throat was burning, but I had to choke through a few more words. "I can't do this anymore Miles. I'm not cut out for it. I quit the band!"

I turned away and picked up my case, throwing my trumpet inside, zipping it shut as I ran to the exit door.

"Do you really wanna give up that easily, Simon?" Miles' voice echoed as the door slammed shut behind me.

After that I cried under the stairs. It hadn't been the first time that dark corner saw me like this. sat there wondering why I couldn't be like him. Jazz was all I was good at, not classes or sports or meeting people. But my skill never showed.

I didn't play with anyone after then. Only with my records at home. My favorite *Donna Lee*, an incredibly fast tune. I would always request it during jam sessions, and Miles hated me for it.

In the middle of practicing over the tune, my phone rang. It was Wyatt, the drummer from the band. Squinting my phone wondering why he would call me- it's been a month since I left the jazz combo- I picked it up.

"Hey well look who it is! The mad trumpeter finally picks up!" Wyatt said with a laugh. "We miss you man. I hope you know that" 

"Thanks." I said.

Wyatt caught me up on how the combo was doing now. He said the combo just didn't have the same air without a horn. He mentioned how Miles had started to slack off and hadn't come up with a single new arrangement for the band, and he had been hosting practice sessions less. They still went to the second round competition, but Miles just didn't seem to care nearly as much. 

Hearing all of this, I didn't say a word in response.

"Well look. Here's my offer to you. Because I miss playing with you man." Wyatt said. "There's this jazz bar that opened up not too long ago. They let minors in without a bracelet, you know the deal. Some jazz program. Place is called 'the Wrong Note.' Thought you might find that funny." Wyatt chuckled. Sometimes he pushes it a little with the jokes. "They're usually pretty busy but I managed to book some tickets. I'll text one to you. Why don't you come along? Just the two of us. Bring the trumpet, too. They do jam sessions at the end."

I paused, but after some thought I decided on "yes." I was starting to miss playing with real people.

The next week, I asked my mom to drive me to the jazz club. Soon enough I was there! It was a small single story building, not connected to any others with its own small parking lot, which was bordering the small entrance.

It had gotten dark an hour ago, and the cool summer air filled my lungs. As my mom drove off I walked up to the glass door with my case. Right as I grabbed the handle, my body froze. What if I was going to mess up again? What would the people think of me if I did? I work so hard to get better, but what if they only saw me as a failure?

I started to get more overwhelmed with my thoughts and I sat down besides the door clutching my head. I knew this would happen, too. I came earlier than Wyatt said... He'd see me outside, he could walk me in. 

I heard a few footsteps come up to me.

"Simon?"

Miles looked down at me with a surprised face. My face went pale- I didn't know what to say. We stared at each other for a handful of seconds. The silence was deafening.

Miles tsked. "Wyatt and his tricks, huh."

"Yeah." I said, staring at the lamps sectioning the road.

"I hope you've been practicing."

I started to stutter, apologizing and telling him about my new rigorous exercise routines.

"Good. You're so frustrating sometimes." Miles said with a smirk. "You're always *this* close to having it all down, I hope you realize that. You been playing out with people? You need to get out of your head."

"No..."

"And now it's time to. Let's go inside."

We walked inside and it was crowded. Musicians, just having finished their song, were moving all around the limelight to exit the stage into the sea of small round chairs where many people dressed in black were sitting down, drinking cocktails and laughing. Wyatt, still left on stage sitting behind the drums, noticed us and a smile grew on his face.

"Hey guys!" Wyatt said as he waved. "Coincidence, huh? Come over- you can sit in on this one. Let's play Donna lee!"

My eyes lit up, and I immediately took out my trumpet, tossed my case onto one of the few empty seats, and ran onto the stage. Behind me, Miles slowly walked up to the piano and stretched his fingers.

When I settled down, I realized everyone was staring at me. The lights were blinding and I felt like an ant under a microscope in the sun. What if I failed again? What if I messed up, and that was all they saw? What if no one would see how hard I worked?

Before I knew it Wyatt counted off and started playing. Caught off guard, I jerked the trumpet to my mouth too late and my first note flopped. Wrong note, wrong key, and it sounded like a chicken being choked.

One man in the audience winced.

Panicking, I started to play notes, since I already messed up the main melody. I ran all around the horn, stammering, running in new directions, hitting a wall, turning around, getting stuck, and then stopping just to start the cycle all over again. I was out of breath too, and the entire time the audience stared. I was messing everything up.

"Psst!" Miles sounded over the music. He mouthed: "Get out of your head."

I continued to run around the trumpet like a headless chicken, until Wyatt made the drums yell by smacking the snare as hard as he could.

I stopped in my tracks. Wyatt said something over the drums, and asked for my response.

I took a deep breath and said the same thing back to him. Miles interjected with a nasty lick, and passed it back to me. I started to run around the horn again. But this time, I would take a moment to stop and listen to where Miles or Wyatt told me to go.

By the end I gave the best live performance of my life. Maybe I'll come back to the combo.
