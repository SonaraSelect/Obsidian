My fingers bobbed up and down on my trumpet valves as I played, but I wasn't really paying attention to the music. Miles, at the piano, looked so focused as he played the underlying chords with his head bent over the instrument, intently watching his fingers sway left and right above the white keys. Occasionally he looked up to make eye contact with me- something he's been telling me jazz musicians do all the time, usually to synchronize with each other and imply when they're going to start or stop, or make a pause for the other to fill in.

But each time he looked over, he seemed annoyed. I would shift my weight to my other foot and shy my eyes away from his glare and count the seats of the empty auditorium. The audience seating was very dim because only the stage lights were on, and a few of the seats were stuck folded down in their open position. I liked the emptiness. *No one to judge me.*

Thwack!

I yelped into the trumpet as a binder slammed into my side. Behind a explosion of sheet music falling through the air, Miles stood up from behind the piano, his face fuming.

"Are you serious, Simon!?" He cried, his voice reverberating across the auditorium. "You always do this. You never pay any attention! And you keep falling off tempo. What have we been working on all this time? Do you even remember the goal of today's session?"

"...call and response." I muttered, rubbing my side.

"And are you even calling?"

"No..."

My ears were burning. I looked to the vacant rows for anyone who could make this end sooner.

"So now what. I just don't know what else you want me to do, Simon. I do so much for you all, and what do you do? You ruined the last competition with how you played over everyone's solos- even the final head of the song! Do you seriously think it's all about you? Your playing isn't even good. It isn't! At least not right now. You're not taking a single break for me to fill in. Instead you just blow a never ending stream of show off slop into your horn at the wrong tempo. Where's the two way communication? At that point you're not even playing jazz anymore." Miles yelled. He put his palm to his face and sighed. His slicked back hair didn't move an inch as he shook his head. "I don't know what to do with you at this point. When we first started working together you became the best player in the band. What happened!? When did you start getting so sloppy. You barely even try. Now, every time we play you tell me I spent all that time with you for nothing. Simon, we have a competition next week."

I stared at him. The binder lay by my feet like a corpse. Eventually, I nodded. "Miles, I'm sorr-"

"Sorry won't cut it, Simon! It's been three weeks of this and you haven't changed one bit." Miles said. "If we don't get platinum this time it'll be all your fault. Do better"

"Maybe I can't, Miles." I cried. "I don't know what I'm supposed to do. I'm trying to focus but I just can't think."

"Well what do you want me to tell you!? You're supposed to stay in time, are you even counting the beats in your head? With your foot?"

"...you're not helping." I said. %% I WANT CHANGE THIS LINE GRAAHHHHH TK %%

"Yes I am! Who's hosting these practice sessions with you so often. Who's writing all your songs? Who's sending you new exercises every week? I do all this just for you to ruin everything. I can't take your shit anymore."

Miles began to stomp towards me. 

"You're never gonna make it like this." 

Taking two steps back, I tripped against the chair behind me and fell down alongside my trumpet. The silver horn clattered against the ground.

Without batting an eye, Miles stormed past me to the exit door across the stage.

"Your fault." He said.

I tried to speak but my sentence couldn't form.

"I quit!" I called after him, but the door had already slammed shut. I was left behind in the dim light with my voice's dying echo.

I sat on the ground, sniffling while staring at the audience of ghosts, all judging me. *I really did ruin that competition for everyone... Maybe performing isn't for me.*

Clearing my throat, I slowly rose from the cold floor and picked up Miles' binder. I dragged myself to the piano and collected the scattered papers from the brown plywood floor and sorted them into the binder. After leaving the binder where it belonged on the piano, I trudged back to my instrument laying on the ground. The trumpet's bell had a huge dent.

The following week, I skipped out on the competition. I skipped the school jazz band and our small jazz combo, and I never messaged anyone about my leave. Wyatt, the drummer, probably told them on my behalf. Him and I were good friends.

As usual, I was spending my time playing along with my collection of jazz records in the unfinished basement. The place looked ridiculous, really. One wall had a wooden beadboard pattern while the rest were drywall. One was painted yellow, pink. The other had a huge glass mirror covering it, and the rough beige carpet topped the room off with an uncomfortable, dirty feeling. The air was musty, too- we never maintained the basement too well and the house was rather old.

But I didn't care. I blasted one of my favorite songs on the record player, *Giant Steps*. It was insanely fast and technical, with insane chords that went all over the place constantly changing keys. It's been my dream to get good at playing over this song, and lately I had been coming close.. But, today, and this entire week, something wasn't right. Every time I tried to play a run my mind would splinter, and when I refocused I would notice I fell off tempo. *Just like Miles had said...* I took the BLANK TK off the record and sat down to stare at the mirror on the wall.

My phone rang. It was Wyatt.

"Hello?" I said.

"Hey, well look who it is! The mad trumpeter finally picks up." Wyatt said, laughing. "We missed you today! I hope you know that."

"Thanks."

"I mean it. The band wasn't the same without you. I felt like Miles doesn't know what to do now that you're not playing over him!" Wyatt chuckled. He always pushed it a little with his jokes. "Well, at least I like to think so. He's been a bit more quiet. He hasn't been putting his whole heart into the band since you left, and all... Anyways. You wanna play out sometime?"

I stared at the dent on my trumpet.

"Does my playing bother you?" I asked.

"What?"

"My playing. I've been trying to play faster lines lately but it just hasn't been working out. I really want to though, but then I just start to think about the last competition," I said. "I'm trying so hard to make it work but it never does. I just want to know, because maybe I *should* stop if it's bothering everybody else. I don't want to ruin things for you guys. I'm so sorry for last competition. I hope things went better today... I bet they did."

"We got gold."

"What?"

"Yup. Same as last time. Maybe we're cursed. Or maybe we needed you. I was serious when I said the bands not the same without you."

"But-"

"Hey, I bet your whole extended solo wasn't a big part of it, either. Last time our bassist and I weren't fully in sync and we didn't do much with dynamics. We just played loud the whole time. It was our problem again- they mentioned it in the workshop today, too. And beyond that, your playing was insane! Regardless of how long you played, you completely locked in and I've never seen you play that fast, like ever." Wyatt paused. "And remember after that, too? You were glowing. You even said that everything has clicked with jazz and you're sure you want to do it for the rest of the life. You were so bubbly during the lunch break, not like your usual stiffness. Give yourself some credit."

"I guess..."

"Don't forget it. So I gotta ask again: You down to play out? I found a new place."

The cool summer air felt refreshing in my lungs. It was only just now starting to cool down. I watched my mom's minivan leave the small parking lot to disappear behind a building as she drove down the street. The building was small despite having its own parking lot: there was a short path to the two glass doors and a big %% NAME TK %% sign above. My trumpet bobbed on my back as I walked to the door.

I raised my hand to open the door, but I froze right at the handlebars. My began to palm feel sweaty. %% THOUGHT TK %% A block of ice was forming in my chest, and I decided to sit down by the grass to take a breather before I entered. I wanted to give my best, after all. I set down my trumpet case and sat down. The grass felt cool under my palms, and I watched an ant march along the ground. %% maybe ant went and saw something TK? %%

"Simon?" said a confused voice ahead of me.

 I jumped. It was Miles, standing by the edge of the entrance pathway with a sour look on his face.

"I thought you quit. What are you doing here?" Miles said, looking down at me.

"I-"

"I don't want to hear it. God, you're frustrating sometimes, you know that?" Miles sighed. "I don't know what to do with you. I spend so much time trying to make you better, and then it works, and then you just run off. We're a supposed to be a team. You're the only horn in the band. We need you. And you just left us in the dirt. Do you know how the others feel?"

"I'm sorry, Miles," I stuttered. "But it's just been too much for me. But today I just couldn't. I've been having so much trouble trying to play right lately, it's been getting to me."




Do you know how much harder most people have to work to get to where you're at? And you just try to toss that away. If I were you, a version of you that plays slow- *actually playing jazz*, I'd be playing out in front of everyone every night, probably making some good money off of it too












"I'm surprised you're still playing." Miles said, looking down at me. "Playing out, I mean."

"Not really. Wyatt brought me here."

"Yeah, he brought me out here too. Isn't that funny."

A car passed by on the road. Miles stared at me, seemingly thinking about something. The silence was deafening.

"I've been meaning to tell you," Miles said, "that... you're really frustrating sometimes."

I frowned.

"I spend so much time trying to make you better, and then it works, and then you just run off. You can be almost pathetic sometimes, I hope you know that Simon." Miles said, staring through me. "It's infuriating, all these exercises just seem to work for you. Do you know how much harder most people have to work to get to where you're at? And you just try to toss that away. If I were you, a version of you that plays slow- *actually playing jazz*, I'd be playing out in front of everyone every night, probably making some good money off of it too."

Miles looked at the ground, then shifted his eyes back at me.

"But you," he paused, "...you, being so promising... you just take it all and betray the medium entirely. You just start playing notes too quickly. Off tempo, too. All these exercises and you apply none of it."

"Maybe you're right." I said, taking a deep breath. "But honestly I don't think I can listen to you any longer. Sure you helped show me how to practice, and you stuck with me as I plateaued and as I got better." I picked up my case and got on my feet. "But why do you have to hate playing fast so much? It gets stuck in my head even- It's not my fault you can't play faster!"

Miles' face went sour. "Oh you think I can't play fast? Get inside. Right now. We're playing Giant Steps. Let's see who's fault it is when you mess up."

The stage lights were blinding, and the place was a bit cramped. A mess of tables were scattered in front of the stage, and almost all the seats were full. The room was filled with the sound of drinks clinking and background chatter. One man was talking to a woman very expressively, another woman was checking her phone. In the back, by the bar, a bartender was shaking a shaker by her chest, her hair swinging around violently as the man sitting by her, elbow on the counter top, watched the stage with his cheek resting on his fist.

"Here's Giant Steps." Miles said into the microphone, before seating himself by the piano. After sitting down he ran a hand through his slicked back hair before looking at Wyatt, behind me. Wyatt gave us a quick thumbs up before tapping his sticks together.

*One. Two. One two three four.*

I blew into the trumpet as the room erupted with our music. We were playing at 210 bpm, and the bassist was vigorously plucking the bass with his entire body. A few people in the crowd clapped just for how fast we were playing. 

Soon we finished the head of the song, and it was my turn to solo. I immediately came in with a run up and then down the registers of my trumpet, my fingers gliding effortlessly over my freshly lubricated trumpet valves.

But I couldn't quite follow the rest of the band. Wyatt was driving the sound with a steady pace, but I kept on speeding up and slowing down, sometimes outrunning his pace before overcompensating and falling behind. Each time I got too far away from him, he would slam the snare to try and call me back, but it was to no avail.

I lowered my horn to try and catch my breath; to take a moment just to think. Within seconds, Miles started playing a line on the piano- he stole my solo. I turned back to Wyatt and he shook his head to say *I don't know either.* 

Miles was glaring at me. *This is my song, not yours.*

I glared back at him and raised my trumpet. I thought of all the times I had practiced and how I always followed Miles' pursuit of perfection. But that wasn't really what I wanted. Looking at Wyatt, he seemed to have so much fun just being here; just being present. That, was what I wanted.

I concentrated on Wyatt's rhythm and my fingers started gliding over the trumpet valves.

Miles stopped and looked at me, astonished.
