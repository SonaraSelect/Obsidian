Miles turned to me with a nod. It was my turn to play. I entered the jazz ballad with a smooth high note on my trumpet, picking up right where he left off at the end of his piano solo. I began to play slow, but I couldn't keep my focus. I didn't know how I was going to tell him.

I was grateful for our band. This was the first time anyone else had ever invited me to do something outside of school. In fact, Miles had invited me first when he started the jazz combo earlier this month. I'll never forget our first practice session at Miles' house, I stood at the door too afraid to knock for 20 minutes. I would've gone home if my mom who dropped me off didn't leave, and before I could finally knock one of the other band members saw me through the window.

Miles was great, really. He arranged all of our songs, composed original tunes- the judges especially liked his song, and he even held one on one practice sessions with all of us like the one we're in right now. But he's become increasingly short tempered since we tied first place. He constantly chewed me out for the final ending high note I played back then- it's so easy for your sound to falter when you're nervous. The others didn't make any sort of mistake like that. They were all so dedicated... Even though I practiced so hard I always feel like it never quite shows.

A binder slammed into my side and I yelped into my trumpet. An explosion of paper floated to the ground by the piano, and behind the falling cloud I saw Miles' face, fuming, as he glared at me.

"You always do this!" he cried. "I keep telling you to play less lines. To take more breaks and let the rhythm section fill in, but you never do!"

"Look," I said. "I'm really sorr-."

"What have I been telling you, Simon? This whole time. You need. to. take. breaks. You need to leave gaps in your playing for the rhythm section to fill in. Are you even paying attention to your playing? This isn't just about you, okay? Jazz is about communication, and you have to listen if you're going to speak. I know you think you can just come here and be the star of the show because you're the only horn in the band, but every time I hear you play you only get more pretentious!" Miles yelled. He dug his face in his right palm, sighing, but before I could speak up he continued. "You're always late, Simon. To practice. Almost every time! And sure. Sure. You can play well. I know you spend all day and night running arpeggios and enclosure exercises until your fingers bleed, but do we seriously have to hear 'oh I can play really fast up and down my instrument' all the damn time? You need to calm down!"

"Miles, really. I'm trying-"

"Well if you really were you'd stop." Miles snorted.

"I just... Look.. Miles I don't know how to tell you this."

Miles raised an eyebrow.

"I've been thinking, with the last competition we had last week. Or well, the first competition I mean..." I stuttered. "I think that you're right-"

"Well look who finally realizes!" Miles said, throwing his hands into the air.

"No, well..." I said, "I've been feeling like I've been holding you guys back." I looked at the floor as I shifted my weight onto my other foot. I had to look away from Miles' demanding stare. "You're right. I've been too selfish in my playing and I just haven't been able to change. I've never been able to change. I almost ruined the last competition for us, and it's left a hole in my chest ever since. I know how excited the rest of you guys are about all of this, and I just..." I paused. I felt a wet streak fall down my cheek. My throat was burning, but I had to choke through a few more words. "I don't want to drag you guys down any further. I think I have to leave the band."

Miles only glared at me with his piercing eyes. I turned away and picked up my case, throwing my trumpet inside, zipping it shut as I ran to the exit door.

"You don't mean that!" Miles called as the door slammed shut behind me.
