My fingers moved along as I blew into my trumpet, but I wasn't really paying attention to my playing. Miles looked so focused as he played underlying chords on the piano with his head bent over the instrument, intently watching his fingers sway above the white keys. Occasionally he looked up to make eye contact with me- earlier Miles had been telling me jazz musicians do this all the time during solos, usually to stay in sync and hint at each other "I'm gonna play this line," or "Hey let's play call and response with this line."

But each time he looked over, especially with that slightly annoyed look, I shifted my weight to my other foot and I looked away. My eyes counted the empty seats of the auditorium, every so often in the rows, some of the folding seat bottoms still stuck open from someone sitting in them. I liked the emptiness, and the dim lighting- we hadn't bothered to turn on the stage lights- made me feel even more at home.

Thwack!

A binder slamming into my side as I yelped into my trumpet. Behind a falling explosion of sheet music in the air, Miles stood up from behind the piano, his face fuming.

"Are you serious, Simon!?" He cried, his voice reverberating across the auditorium. "You always do this. You never pay any attention! What have we been working on all this time. Do you even remember the goal of todays session?"

"...call and response." I muttered, rubbing my side.

"And you are you responding?"

"No..."

*Another one of his tirades.* I looked to the vacant rows for anyone who could make this end sooner.

"So what now. What else do you want me to do. I do so much for you all, and what do you do? You ruined the last competition with how you played over everyone else's solo- and even the final head of the song! Do you seriously think it's all about you? Your playing isn't even good. It isn't! You're just blowing a hot load of musical diarrhea into your horn! And you never stop playing, not even a single break for me to fill in. At that point you're not even playing jazz anymore. Just a bunch of show-off slop." Miles said. He covered his face with his palm and took a deep breath. His slick brown hair didn't move an inch as he shook his head. "I don't know what to do with you at this point. After we first started practicing together you become the best player in the band. What happened!? When did you start getting so careless. You barely even try. Now every time we play you tell me all my hard work was for naught."

I stared at him. The binder lied by my feet like a corpse. My heart was pounding.

"Well, maybe it isn't just my fault!" I said, my voice getting louder.

"You can't be serious."

"Maybe it's not my fault that I have to play with you." I said, my voice wavering. "Maybe if I could play without having to worry about you yelling I'd be better-"

"You started playing like shit before I started yelling. It's because you play like shit that I'm yelling!"

"No, but..." I stuttered. He wasn't entirely wrong. "But you're not helping."

"Yes I am! Who's hosting these practice sessions with you so often. Who's writing all your songs? Who's sending you new exercises for every week? I do all this, and for what. I can't take your shit anymore." 

Miles stomped towards me. I took two steps back and tripped against the chair behind me, falling down with my trumpet. The silver horn clattered against the ground.

Without batting an eye, Miles stormed past me to the exit door.

"Your fault." He said.

I tried to form a sentence but only jumbled words came out. I looked at my trumpet- the horn received a big dent.

"I quit!" I called after him, but the door had already slammed shut. I was left behind in the dim light with my voice's dying echo.

I sat there, tears starting to roll down my burning cheeks, as I stared at the audience of ghosts, all judging me. *I really did ruin that competition for everyone... Maybe performing isn't for me. Before all this I was happy just playing to records alone in my basement.* 

After sniffling, I slowly rose from the cold floor and picked up Miles' binder. I dragged myself to the piano and collected the scattered papers off the brown plywood floor, and I sorted them into the binder, there was a folder for every genre of music, finally placing the binder back where it belong on the piano.

A month passed. For a whole month I hadn't played any music outside- I stopped showing up to the school jazz band and our small jazz combo, and I never messaged anyone about my leave. Wyatt, our drummer and an old friend of mine, probably told them on my behalf. He messaged me sometimes about school and jazz, and I only replied sometimes. We had barely spoken in the past month.

As usual, I was spending my time playing along with my collection of jazz records in the unfinished basement. The place looked ridiculous, really. One wall had a wooden beadboard pattern while the rest were drywall. One was painted yellow, and another painted pink. The other had a huge glass mirror covering it, and the rough beige carpet topped the room off with an uncomfortable, dirty feeling. The air was musty, too- we never maintained the basement too well and the house was rather old.

But I didn't care. I blasted my favorite album- it was filled with high speed, technical bebop tunes- and I played with my own musical ideas over the recorded musician's music. In between songs, I realized my phone was ringing. It was Wyatt, our drummer. 

"Hello?" I said.

"Hey, look who it is! The mad trumpeter finally picks up." Wyatt said, laughing. "We miss you. I hope you know that."

I opened my mouth to speak, but Wyatt cut me off before my words could come out.

"I mean it. The band's not the same without you. Miles doesn't know what to do now that you're not playing over him!" Wyatt chuckled. He always pushed it a little with his jokes. "Well at least I like to think so. He's been kind of weird since you became a no-show. A bit calmer, though, which is good. Anyways, you wanna jam sometime? Just us."

"I don't know..." I said. "I'm a little busy and I don't have much time..." 

Wyatt and I had been friends long before Miles invited us to the jazz combo, and we used to practice all the time together, but we could never focus. Wyatt would always ramble about something crazy, never stopping even when we finally would sit down with our instruments, and when he finally finished talking he would just play a bunch of drum lines and ask me if they sounded cool. We never got anything done and I never practiced much outside of those sessions, which is probably the reason I was so mediocre back then, before I met Miles.

"Alright." Wyatt said. "Do you you wanna play out instead? I found a new place."

I paused.

"I don't know... I don't think I'm cut out for that kind of stuff anymore." I said. "I'm happy just keeping things to myself and the records. Besides I think my playing has been too much of a mess lately, and they'd hate to hear it, I bet."

Wyatt paused, constructing his response. "What are you saying!? I love your style! It's like if Parker was more avant garde and played trumpet. I don't know anyone else who can hold their breath for as long as you, nor anyone else who can play the same run but with a different spin on it 5 times in a row."

"You know it pisses Miles off so much when I do that."

"And maybe that means it's even cooler! You should come out man."

"Still, I..." I thought for a moment, "I'm just not feeling it. I don't think I want to play out anymore."

"I don't believe that. Despite how it ended, remember the start of our first competition? You were so nervous- I saw how you were shaking on stage for the first set- but when we played *Donna Lee* you were completely locked in. You dominated the fastest tune there is! And then when we grabbed food after, you were so happy, you were even laughing and making jokes with Miles and you've always been super stiff around him. You're usually really stiff in general... it was nice to see you loosen up."

I thought about that time. He was right, I had panicked so much about the competition- our first competition- that I almost didn't go. And while I spent most of our performances panicking, for just one song, *Donna Lee*, the stars aligned and I had the most fun playing the trumpet of my life. I always hated crowds, but that night that song made me feel like I could do anything.

"Hm. I guess I might try again just one more time." I said.

***

I took a deep breath of the cool summer night air as my mom's drove off past the neighboring buildings. The bar was a small place and it had its own little parking lot. The only source of light was the big glowing "Parker's Run" sign above the two glass doors. I couldn't see inside as I walked up, my trumpet case bobbing behind my back.

My hand moved toward the door, I could still hear Miles' yelling at me. I tried to push the handle but my arm was completely frozen. *They wouldn't want to hear my musical diarrhea.* 

\>>>>>>>>
. *What if I mess up again? Playing over everyone. They might all hate me for it*.

I wanted to go inside, but instead I sat on the grass by the door staring at the ground. Maybe I would find the courage eventually.

I heard some footsteps approach me.

"Simon?"

Miles looked down at me with a surprised face. My face went pale- I didn't know what to say. We stared at each other for a handful of seconds. The silence was interrupted only by a car passing by on the street.

Miles tsked. "Wyatt and his tricks, huh. He didn't tell me about this"

"Yeah." I said, staring at the lamps sectioning the road.

"I hope you've been practicing."

I started to stutter, apologizing and telling about playing over the records.

"God. You're so frustrating sometimes." Miles said. "What you really need is to play with real people. You need to leave the basement. You're this close to having it down. It's good for you that Wyatt managed to drag you out here."

I stared at the grass.

"Get up. We should be on soon. And don't play over me this time, alright?"

We walked inside and it was crowded. Musicians, just having finished their song, were moving all around the limelight to exit the stage into the sea of small round chairs where many people dressed in black were sitting down, drinking cocktails and laughing. Wyatt, still left on stage sitting behind the drums, noticed us and a smile grew on his face.

"Hey guys!" Wyatt said as he waved. "Coincidence, huh? Come over- you can sit in on this one. Let's play Donna lee!"

My eyes lit up, and I immediately took out my trumpet, tossed my case onto one of the few empty seats, and ran onto the stage. Behind me, Miles slowly walked up to the piano and stretched his fingers.

When I settled down, I realized everyone was staring at me. The lights were blinding and I felt like an ant under a microscope in the sun. Everyone was staring, each gaze like a spear impaling me. I focused my breath and tried to imagine I was between the pink and yellow walls of my basement.

Before I knew it Wyatt counted off and started playing. Caught off guard, I jerked the trumpet to my mouth too late and my first note flopped. Wrong note, wrong key, and it sounded like a chicken being choked.

One man in the audience winced.

Panicking, I started to play notes, since I already messed up the main melody. I ran all around the horn, stammering, running in new directions, hitting a wall, turning around, getting stuck, and then stopping just to start the cycle all over again. I was out of breath too, and the entire time the audience stared. I was messing everything up.

"Psst!" Miles sounded over the music. He mouthed: "Get out of your head."

I continued to run around the trumpet like a headless chicken, until Wyatt made the drums yell by smacking the snare as hard as he could.

I stopped in my tracks. Wyatt said something over the drums, and asked for my response.

I took a deep breath and said the same thing back to him. Miles interjected with a nasty lick, and passed it back to me. I started to run around the horn again. But this time, I would take a moment to stop and listen to where Miles or Wyatt told me to go.

By the end I gave the best live performance of my life. Maybe I'll come back to the combo.
