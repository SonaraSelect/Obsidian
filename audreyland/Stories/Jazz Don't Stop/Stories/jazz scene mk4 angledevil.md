My fingers moved along as I blew into my trumpet, but I wasn't really paying attention to my playing. Miles looked so focused as he played underlying chords on the piano with his head bent over the instrument, intently watching his fingers sway above the white keys. Occasionally he looked up to make eye contact with me- earlier Miles had been telling me jazz musicians do this all the time during solos, usually to stay in sync and hint at each other "I'm gonna play this line," or "Hey let's play call and response with this line."

But each time he looked over, especially with that slightly annoyed look, I shifted my weight to my other foot and I looked away. My eyes counted the empty seats of the auditorium, every so often in the rows, some of the folding seat bottoms still stuck open from someone sitting in them. I liked the emptiness, and the dim lighting- we hadn't bothered to turn on the stage lights- made me feel even more at home.

Thwack!

A binder slamming into my side as I yelped into my trumpet. Behind a falling explosion of sheet music in the air, Miles stood up from behind the piano, his face fuming.

"Are you serious, Simon!?" He cried, his voice reverberating across the auditorium. "You always do this. You never pay any attention! What have we been working on all this time. Do you even remember the goal of todays session?"

"...call and response." I muttered, rubbing my side.

"And you are you responding?"

"No..."

*Another one of his tirades.* I looked to the vacant rows for anyone who could make this end sooner.

"So what now. What else do you want me to do. I do so much for you all, and what do you do? You ruined the last competition with how you played over everyone's solos- and even the final head of the song! Do you seriously think it's all about you? Your playing isn't even good. It isn't! You're just blowing a hot load of musical diarrhea into your horn! And you never stop playing, not even a single break for me to fill in. At that point you're not even playing jazz anymore. Just a bunch of show-off slop." Miles said. He covered his face with his palm and took a deep breath. His slick brown hair didn't move an inch as he shook his head. "I don't know what to do with you at this point. After we first started practicing together you become the best player in the band. What happened!? When did you start getting so careless. You barely even try. Now every time we play you tell me all my hard work was for naught."

I stared at him. The binder lay by my feet like a corpse. My heart was pounding.

"Well, maybe it isn't just my fault!" I said, my voice getting louder.

"You can't be serious."

"Maybe it's not my fault that I have to play with you." I said, my voice wavering. "Maybe if I could play without having to worry about you yelling I'd be better-"

"You started playing like shit before I started yelling. It's because you play like shit that I'm yelling!"

"No, but..." I stuttered. He wasn't entirely wrong. "But you're not helping."

"Yes I am! Who's hosting these practice sessions with you so often. Who's writing all your songs? Who's sending you new exercises for every week? I do all this just for you to ruin everything. I can't take your shit anymore." 

Miles stomped towards me. Taking two steps back, I tripped against the chair behind me, falling down with my trumpet. The silver horn clattered against the ground.

Without batting an eye, Miles stormed past me to the exit door.

"Your fault." He said.

I tried to form a sentence but only jumbled words came out. I looked at my trumpet- the horn got a big dent from the fall.

"I quit!" I called after him, but the door had already slammed shut. I was left behind in the dim light with my voice's dying echo.

I sat there, cheeks burning, as I stared at the audience of ghosts, all judging me. *I really did ruin that competition for everyone... Maybe performing isn't for me. Before all this I was happy just playing to records alone in my basement.* 

After sniffling, I slowly rose from the cold floor and picked up Miles' binder. I dragged myself to the piano and collected the scattered papers off the brown plywood floor, and I sorted them into the binder, there was a folder for every genre of music, finally placing the binder back where it belong on the piano.

A month passed. For a whole month I hadn't played any music outside- I stopped showing up to the school jazz band and our small jazz combo, and I never messaged anyone about my leave. Wyatt, our drummer and an old friend of mine, probably told them on my behalf. He messaged me sometimes about school and jazz, and I only replied sometimes. We had barely spoken in the past month.

As usual, I was spending my time playing along with my collection of jazz records in the unfinished basement. The place looked ridiculous, really. One wall had a wooden beadboard pattern while the rest were drywall. One was painted yellow, and another painted pink. The other had a huge glass mirror covering it, and the rough beige carpet topped the room off with an uncomfortable, dirty feeling. The air was musty, too- we never maintained the basement too well and the house was rather old.

But I didn't care. I blasted my favorite album- it was filled with high speed, technical bebop tunes- and I played with my own musical ideas over the recorded musician's music. In between songs, I realized my phone was ringing. It was Wyatt, our drummer. 

"Hello?" I said.

"Hey, look who it is! The mad trumpeter finally picks up." Wyatt said, laughing. "We miss you. I hope you know that."

I opened my mouth to speak, but Wyatt cut me off before my words could come out.

"I mean it. The band's not the same without you. Miles doesn't know what to do now that you're not playing over him!" Wyatt chuckled. He always pushed it a little with his jokes. "Well at least I like to think so. He's been kind of weird since you became a no-show. A bit calmer, though, which is good. Anyways, you wanna jam sometime? Just us."

"I don't know..." I said. "I'm a little busy and I don't have much time..." 

Wyatt and I had been friends long before Miles invited us to the jazz combo, and we used to practice all the time together, but we could never focus. Wyatt would always ramble about something crazy, never stopping even when we finally would sit down with our instruments, and when he finally finished talking he would just play a bunch of drum lines and ask me if they sounded cool. We never got anything done and I never practiced much outside of those sessions, which is probably the reason I was so mediocre back then, before I met Miles.

"Alright." Wyatt said. "Do you you wanna play out instead? I found a new place."

I paused.

"I don't know... I don't think I'm cut out for that kind of stuff anymore." I said. "I'm happy just keeping things to myself and the records. Besides I think my playing has been too much of a mess lately, and they'd hate to hear it, I bet."

Wyatt paused, constructing his response. "What are you saying!? I love your style! It's like if Parker was more avant garde and played trumpet. I don't know anyone else who can hold their breath for as long as you, nor anyone else who can play the same run but with a different spin on it 5 times in a row."

"You know it pisses Miles off so much when I do that."

"And maybe that means it's even cooler! You should come out man."

"Still..." I thought for a moment. "I'm just not feeling it. I don't think I want to play out anymore."

"I don't believe that. Despite how it ended, remember the start of our first competition? You were so nervous- I saw how you were shaking on stage for the first set- but when we played *Donna Lee* you were completely locked in. You dominated the fastest tune there is! And then when we grabbed food after, you were so happy, you were even laughing and making jokes with Miles and you've always been super stiff around him. You're usually really stiff in general... it was nice to see you loosen up."

I thought about that time. He was right, I had panicked so much about the competition- our first competition- that I almost didn't go. And while I spent most of our performances panicking, for just one song, *Donna Lee*, the stars aligned and I had the most fun playing the trumpet of my life. I always hated crowds, but that night that song made me feel like I could do anything.

"Hm. I guess I might try again just one more time." I said.

I took a deep breath of the cool summer night air as my mom's drove off past the neighboring buildings. The bar was a small place and it had its own little parking lot. The only source of light was the big glowing "Parker's Run" sign above the two glass doors. I couldn't see inside as I walked up, my trumpet case strapped to my back, bobbing behind me.

My hand moved toward the door, but the moment I made contact with the handlebars I froze. *They'd hate how messy my playing is.* A block of ice started to form in my chest, and I decided to sit down on the grass by the door to cool off before I entered the bar. I wanted to move with my best foot forward after all.

I sat down. The opaque clouds made visible by the city's light pollution. An ant was slowly marching through the blades of grass by my foot.

"What are you doing here?"

 I jumped. It was Miles.

"I'm surprised you're still playing." Miles said, looking down at me. "Playing out, I mean."

"Not really. Wyatt brought me here."

"Yeah, he brought me out here too. Isn't that funny."

A car passed by on the road. Miles stared at me, seemingly thinking about something. The silence was stressing me out.

"I've been meaning to tell you," Miles said, "that... you're really frustrating sometimes."

I frowned.

"I spend so much time trying to make you better, and then it works, and then you just run off. You can be almost pathetic sometimes, I hope you know that Simon." Miles said, staring straight at me. "It's infuriating, all these exercises just seem to work for you. Do you know how much harder most people have to work to get to where you're at? And you just try to toss that away. If I were you, a version of you that plays slow- *actually playing jazz*, I'd be playing out in from of everyone every night, probably making some good money off of it too."

Miles looked at the ground, then shifted his eyes back at me.

"But you," he paused "...you, being so promising... you just take it all and betray the medium entirely. You just start playing notes too quickly. Off tempo, too. All these exercises and you apply none of it."

"Maybe you're right." I said, taking a deep breath. "But honestly I don't think I can listen to you any longer. Sure you helped show me how to practice, and you stuck with me as I plateaued and as I got better." I picked up my case and stood up. "But why do you have to hate playing fast so much. It gets stuck in my head- It's not my fault you can't play faster!"

Miles' face went sour. "Oh you think I can't play fast? Go inside right now. We're playing Giant Steps. Let's see who's fault it is when you mess up."
