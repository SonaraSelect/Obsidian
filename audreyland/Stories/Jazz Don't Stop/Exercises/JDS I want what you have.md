### One wants something the other has
- Magical samurai "go full force!"
- literal argument between two characters over minute thing (doesnt have to be deep)
- This thing could save people but owner doesnt want to break it
- Deep in rahnarth, desperation consuming

### Times this has happened in my life
- Getting someone to play a game
- Getting someone to help me with something
- Asking too much of someone for free stuff




Simon and Livvy
- giving the keys to a thing
	- Maybe Livvy is new to the group and Simon envies her and deep down wants to sort of sabotage her in some way

Livvy wants
- Miles phone number to join band
- Keys to practice room or something (This is simon's personal space and he doesnt want her intruding, hes kind of jealous of her too so that makes him even more against it)
