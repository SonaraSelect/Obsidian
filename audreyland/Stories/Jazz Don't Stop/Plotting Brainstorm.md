[[Wyatt]] brings [[Livvy]] and [[Simon]] into the mix, [[Miles]] just happens to be there that time?

**Simon being hard on Livvy would probably be awful for her**

\> Scene where Wyatt (probably) mutters that Miles is such a hard ass because he's into classical and wants to do that instead, which makes Miles FREAK OUT
\> Scene where Simon is just giving the band no space to fill in AT ALL and then Wyatt finds a way to join in and play with him, anticipating his rhythm in some crazy flow state way



First story is about them getting together, learning to get along with one another, and playing their first gig
