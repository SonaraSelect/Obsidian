FIRST OFF. Does the group know Miles before they get into the band together? Actually... if not that's okay I feel. He won't explode on them until he really starts to care about them, so I think this will work, actually.


[[Wyatt]] starts the band. It began with him and [[Miles]] jamming together pretty often, and they kind of got along ((--like that zen state where Wyatt is able to let Miles let loose and play freely)). Then they decide to start a combo and Wyatt brings in [[Livvy]] and [[Simon]].

They're first time playing together is pretty alright, but Miles is really stiff, Wyatt gets too excited and rushes here and there, Simon leaves no space for the others, and well... Livvy kinda is just there. She does great.

Maybe music teacher walks in, says wow you guys are spectacular. Are you guys trying to start a band? And they all look at each other and shrug "Yes!" Then the teacher helps them schedule a bar gig next week, and now they gotta practice. THIS is where Miles starts to get critical. He reaally wants this to be good.

**Will we have their gig be the first thing, or will their competition be first**





[[Wyatt]] brings [[Livvy]] and [[Simon]] into the mix, [[Miles]] just happens to be there that time?

**Simon being hard on Livvy would probably be awful for her**

\> Scene where Wyatt (probably) mutters that Miles is such a hard ass because he's into classical and wants to do that instead, which makes Miles FREAK OUT
\> Scene where Simon is just giving the band no space to fill in AT ALL and then Wyatt finds a way to join in and play with him, anticipating his rhythm in some crazy flow state way
\> Scene where Livvy comes home late after doing poorly on an exam for the first time and her dad blows up on her and pushes her to the ground, apologizes and sheds a few tears for her afterwards
\> Scene where Wyatt finally gets Miles to play his heart out and loosen up mid performance. Finally Miles starts to let loose and really get expressive/creative with his playing, before he was sabotaging himself being too afraid to break the grain

First story is about them getting together, learning to get along with one another, and playing their first gig
