# Story of Genesis
*The tale of Sho-Terra-Nu and her Revnyris*

In the beginning there was naught. Not a void, not even an emptiness. Truly nothing.
Until she was born, created by she alone, creator of all: Sho-Terra-Nu.

In the eternity of nothingness, she thought of light. And then there was light.
Startled by her creation, her mind jumped to something else.

She thought of land. And then there was land.
Of the sky. And then there was the sky.
Of the mountains, the valleys, the waterfalls, the sun, the deserts, and all the animals. And there they were.

But the animals simply stood there, inanimate. Bored, she looked to the nothingness beyond the world, and thought of the void.
And then there was Eneon, the god of the void; the god of hunger, who sat patiently in his nothingness, watching Sho-Terra-Nu from afar.

With Eneon's presence, the water in the world began to break mountains and carve canyons, occasionally flooding and drowning the unmoving, lifeless animals.

As she watched Eneon devour them, stripping them from existence, she felt pain. She wanted the animals to avoid the floods and other disasters, and she thought of life.

In that moment, Revnyris, the goddess of blood in all her glory, sprouted up before her, and Revnyris embedded herself into the animals, adorning them with her life essence.

It became a ritual. Sho-Terra-Nu would think of a new being, her idea a gift to the other goddess, and Revnyris would take it and imbue herself into Sho-Terra-Nu's creation, using all her might to adorn it with her endless passion until it was time for Eneon to devour.

To prolong how long Revnyris could imbue herself into Sho-Terra-Nu's creations, they taught the creatures to survive, and the creatures lived in great harmony together.

Sho-Terra-Nu would create a vessel, and Revnyris, aching to enter it, would coarse through the veins of the creature, and as the two goddesses resonated with each other in shared creation they would bask in the resulting sunsets of creation.

They continued this ritual for eons, and it was good.

Until Eneon's destruction began to surface again. Some unlucky creatures were trapped in disasters, and she watched them die. Her thoughts raced towards all the possible evils of the world, and there the evils were.

She thought of famine, of war, of murder, of abuse. And there it was, and it was not good.

Revnyris saw her panic, but all she could do was continue the ritual with her, as it was the only thing that could ease her mind. But it wasn't enough. Eneon continued to devour and devour, spawning more and more evils.

Soon Sho-Terra-Nu became completely unresponsive, lost in her endless looping thoughts. Things would appear randomly, without reason. New laws, animals, monsters, and even minor gods.

Watching the rotting husk of her love, Revnyris knew what needed to be done to save what was left of their creations from the evils to come.

With the help of a thousand minor gods, Revnyris raised her sacred sword and sliced Sho-Terra-Nu into a thousand pieces, and her frenzied terror of creation came to a near halt.

While her remnants still think today- Revnyris still performs the creation ritual of life with what's left every sunset- though her power has been greatly reduced, and the world is safe, even if all already spawned evils are still left to reign terror.

The three largest pieces are named Sho, Terra, and Nue. Embodying creation, earth, and false animation respectively. We do not know the goddess of creation's true name. It is said that if someone can gather enough pieces, they may be able to harness Sho-Terra-Nu's power and please themselves with endless creation.

As for today, no one has found enough pieces. They are so scattered that many question if they really exist.
