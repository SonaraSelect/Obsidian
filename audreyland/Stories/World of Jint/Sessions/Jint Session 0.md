*The tale of Sho-Terra-Nu and her Revnyris*

This story is older than the king.

In the beginning there was naught. Not a void, not even an emptiness. Truly nothing.
Until she was born, created by she alone, creator of all: Sho-Terra-Nu.

In the eternity of nothingness, she thought of light. And then there was light.
Shocked by her creation, he mind began to wander.

She thought of land. And then there was land.
Of the sky. And then there was the sky.
Of the mountains, the valleys, the waterfalls, the sun, the deserts, and all the animals. And there they were.

But the animals simply stood there, inanimate. Bored, she looked to the nothingness beyond the world, and thought of the void.
And then there was Eneon, the god of the void; the god of hunger, who sat patiently in his nothingness, watching Sho-Terra-Nu from afar.

"Give to me all things when they expire, and let me devour them." said the void incarnate.

She met eyes with his dark silhouette, and nodded before returning to her other creations. With Eneon's presence, the water in the world began to break mountains and carve canyons, occasionally flooding and drowning the unmoving, lifeless animals.

As she watched Eneon devour them, she felt pain. She wanted the animals to avoid the floods and other disasters, and she thought of life.

In that moment, Revnyris, the goddess of blood in all her glory, sprouted up before her, and Revnyris embedded herself into the animals, adorning them with her life essence.

It became a ritual. Sho-Terra-Nu would think of a new being, her idea a gift to the other goddess, and Revnyris would take it and imbue herself into Sho-Terra-Nu's creation, adorning it with love with all her might until it was time for Eneon's feast, this love created a beautiful sunset with every ritual.

To prolong how long Revnyris could adorn herself with Sho-Terra-Nu's creations, they taught the creatures to survive, and the creatures lived in great harmony together.

Sho-Terra-Nu would create a vessel, and Revnyris, with all her desire for her, would coarse through the veins of the creature, and as they resonated with each other's joy they would bask in the sunset of their creation.

They continued this love ritual for eons, and it was good.

Until Eneon's destruction began to surface again. Some unlucky creatures were trapped in disasters, and she watched them die. Her thoughts raced towards all the possible evils of the world, and there the evils were.

She thought of famine, of war, of murder, of abuse. And there it was, and it was not good.

Revnyris saw her panic, but all she could do was continue her love ritual with Sho-Terra-Nu, as it was the only thing that could ease her mind. But it wasn't enough. Eneon continued to devour and devour.

Soon Sho-Terra-Nu became completely unresponsive, lost in her endless looping thoughts. Things would appear randomly, without reason. New laws, animals, monsters, and even minor gods.

Watching the rotting husk of her love, Revnyris knew what needed to be done to save what was left of their creations from the evils to come.

With the help of a thousand minor gods, Revnyris raised her sacred sword and sliced Sho-Terra-Nu into a thousand pieces, and her frenzied terror of creation came to a near halt.

While her remnants still think today- Revnyris still performs the creation ritual of life with what's left every sunset- her power has been greatly reduced, and the world is safe, even if all already spawned evils are still left to reign terror.

The three largest pieces are named Sho, Terra, and Nue. Embodying creation, earth, and false animation respectively. We do not know the goddess of creation's true name. It is said that if someone can gather enough pieces, they may be able to harness Sho-Terra-Nu's power and please themselves with endless creation.

As for today, no one has found enough pieces. They are so scattered that many question if they really exist. The gods are believed to exist, but some think they may be slowly leaving us. They have not contacted us in eons, but
