*Welcome to the World of Jint, my friends*

"And I looked at them all. A futile squabble between each nation to prove a 'true god.' See they not the resurgence of the antediluvian trifecta awaiting us amidst the end of everything? Merely, as all, it is a matter of time, and we must unify if we wish for rapture once the cradle of perfection is to dually arrive."

## Mythology
*The tale of Sho-Terra-Nu and her Revnyris*

In the beginning there was naught. Not a void, not even an emptiness. Truly nothing.
Until she was born, created by she alone, creator of all: Sho-Terra-Nu.

In the eternity of nothingness, she thought of light. And then there was light.
Startled by her creation, her mind jumped to something else.

She thought of land. And then there was land.
Of the sky. And then there was the sky.
Of the mountains, the valleys, the waterfalls, the sun, the deserts, and all the animals. And there they were.

But the animals simply stood there, inanimate. Bored, she looked to the nothingness beyond the world, and thought of the void.
And then there was Eneon, the god of the void; the god of hunger, who sat patiently in his nothingness, watching Sho-Terra-Nu from afar.

With Eneon's presence, the water in the world began to break mountains and carve canyons, occasionally flooding and drowning the unmoving, lifeless animals.

As she watched Eneon devour them, stripping them from existence, she felt pain. She wanted the animals to avoid the floods and other disasters, and she thought of life.

In that moment, Revnyris, the goddess of blood in all her glory, sprouted up before her, and Revnyris embedded herself into the animals, adorning them with her life essence.

It became a ritual. Sho-Terra-Nu would think of a new being, her idea a gift to the other goddess, and Revnyris would take it and imbue herself into Sho-Terra-Nu's creation, using all her might to adorn it with her endless passion until it was time for Eneon to devour.

To prolong how long Revnyris could imbue herself into Sho-Terra-Nu's creations, they taught the creatures to survive, and the creatures lived in great harmony together.

Sho-Terra-Nu would create a vessel, and Revnyris, aching to enter it, would coarse through the veins of the creature, and as the two goddesses resonated with each other in shared creation they would bask in the resulting sunsets of creation.

They continued this ritual for eons, and it was good.

Until Eneon's destruction began to surface again. Some unlucky creatures were trapped in disasters, and she watched them die. Her thoughts raced towards all the possible evils of the world, and there the evils were.

She thought of famine, of war, of murder, of abuse. And there it was, and it was not good.

Revnyris saw her panic, but all she could do was continue the ritual with her, as it was the only thing that could ease her mind. But it wasn't enough. Eneon continued to devour and devour, spawning more and more evils.

Soon Sho-Terra-Nu became completely unresponsive, lost in her endless looping thoughts. Things would appear randomly, without reason. New laws, animals, monsters, and even minor gods.

Watching the rotting husk of her love, Revnyris knew what needed to be done to save what was left of their creations from the evils to come.

With the help of a thousand minor gods, Revnyris raised her sacred sword and sliced Sho-Terra-Nu into a thousand pieces, and her frenzied terror of creation came to a near halt.

While her remnants still think today- Revnyris still performs the creation ritual of life with what's left every sunset- though her power has been greatly reduced, and the world is safe, even if all already spawned evils are still left to reign terror.

The three largest pieces are named Sho, Terra, and Nue. Embodying creation, earth, and false animation respectively. We do not know the goddess of creation's true name. It is said that if someone can gather enough pieces, they may be able to harness Sho-Terra-Nu's power and please themselves with endless creation.

As for today, no one has found enough pieces. They are so scattered that many question if they really exist.

## History
*Great King Jude*

For the longest time, the continent of Ataxia was in a state of endless war, filled with nations in strife over which god exists. You see, in the early eras, the old gods were much closer to us and mankind was able to utilize each of their powers, but one couldn't channel every god. Only one, and the god you were connected to was determined completely by your lineage.

Since most nations and minor kingdoms had similar blood within their people, each nation's population would most often be able to channel the same god, leading to this confusion of there only being one god. Beyond that, the god a group believed in deeply molded their culture. Nations in the name of Eneon are ruthless and domineering people who are hungry to pillage other lands, followers of Revnyris hold the art of perfecting their bodies and livelihood above all else, followers of Sho dedicated their lives to creating magnificent wonders of engineering, believers of Nue deeply involved their late ancestors in their culture, the list goes on.

Naturally, these people fought with one another. But it wasn't until the emergence of the great prophet conqueror, King Jude, suspected to originate from an unknown tribe in Mt. Olympus, that the people would find some amount of unity. He posed a theory of everything: the existence of Sho-Terra-Nu. An explanation of how all the gods came to be, and why everything existed the way it does.

He spread his word throughout the continent, most often forcing it over people through conquest, and eventually he had unified over 100 groups to create the sprawling empire that is the Kingdom of Jude today. This was a thousand years ago, and mysteriously enough, Jude is still alive today and said to live a thousand more- a feat not possible of any other living creature of this world (Elves do not live more than 600-800 years here).
## Present Times
*And so the adventure begins*

You live in this [[Kingdom of Jude]], a gigantic [[Sho-Terra-Nu|Sho-Terran]] empire spanning most of the continent that was unified many centuries ago by the great [[King Jude]]. To you, living here has always been bearable at the very least. 

\>>>>
The government handles most things, like assigning people jobs, controlling the flow of goods, and providing nearly all the necessary basic services. But living isn't always easy. A couple generations ago inflation started to take over, and most lower class people work 1-2 unofficial jobs alongside their government assigned one. One 
<<<<

, but things have gone awry:

Rumors have it the king has gone missing. Some think there's a coup going on- even though they have managed to stay in control for most of his lifetime, and others think they have died- despite the few and far between rumors that he was immortal.

What you do know is whoever is in control has enacted martial law, and there have been reports of royal guards abducting people from their homes, seemingly at random- something unexpected after centuries of peace. The criminal factions you've been in touch with all seem to be preparing for war, and there have been more royal guards moving through your streets than ever seen before.

You have also heard about something from some drunken information broker at your favorite dingy tavern: Mount Olympus, the tallest mountain in all the land, is rumored to have collapsed- for reasons uncertain. She said it left behind no rubble, instead there is a valley in its place- one cradling a gigantic ancient city. A strange, desolate place riddled with esoteric artifacts channeling types of magic never seen before. She said this City of the Valley is a living and breathing thing, but you don't understand what that really means. All you know for certain is that there are people selling these alleged magical artifacts for a really, really high price.

And one important thing. One of these curios is going to make an appearance at a black market auction near you.

# Character Creation
*Just ask me tbh I'll tell you*

So yes, 

- Other races: talk about how most died out and only the none complete purebloods can channel the old gods
## Regions
### Kingdom of Jude sub areas
- [[Estopoles|Estopoles (port city)]] - a port town much like Gibraltar that's a trading hotspot between Jude and the other nations
- [[Ayer]] (region) - 
- [[Cochichuan]] (region) - 
- [[Mendon]] (region) -
- 
### Other Nations
- [[Land of Golden Hands]] - a religious fanatic city state where the church rules over everything
	- Based off of HBI's. They believe they are the chosen race of people, since no one (but the Terra-Nue fanatics) reject [[Revnyris]] as the goddess of life.
	- They're [[Revnyris]] cultists and they have a lot of strange rituals.
		- They believe in perfecting the body to let as much blood run free. These people are usually very fit and have beliefs about consuming the blood of their enemies, of certain animals, etc. Every few months they hold rituals where they drink the raw blood of the [[Golden Holy Animal]].
	- **Why you'd find them in Jude:**
		- Some people do still believe in [[Revnyris]] but draw a line at the human sacrifices performed on special rituals (based off Aztecs, they compete)
- [[Gorne Empire]] - framed a bit after Britain, has tense relations with Jude. Their puppets have fairly good relations with Jude, however.
	- They follow [[Eneon]] as their dominant god
	- **Why you'd find them in Jude:**
		- Spies, lots of em. It's hard for Gornians to stay in Jude for long periods of time, but those who pass in are often missionaries, defectors, or %% TK %%
	- Puppets:
		- **[[Neia]]** - 
			- **In Jude because:** 
		- [[Rur]] - 
			- **In Jude because:** 
- [[Isles of Delenne]] ([[Delenne]])- some islands (inspired by Hawaii). They have a unique fighting style, a unique accent, and they're a hotspot for mages, as a handful of ancient temples were built in this area long ago and the area has an affinity for magic. They have some of the best universities in magic and magical practices
			- **In Jude because:** they travel around, some teach magic, some migrate to Jude because  %% TK %% 
- [[Haik Rebellion]] - was once a Gorne colony, but they rebelled in an epic civil war with the help of Jude.
	- **Why you'd find them in Jude:**
