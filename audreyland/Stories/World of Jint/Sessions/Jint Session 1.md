They should start in the Kingdom of Jude


***
- 90 minutes per scene

- Premise
	- 

Things that excite me
- Reja is actually a Gorne inquisitor?
	- Maybe shes lowkey a purifier or some shit
- Go to cave something wherever and see Wide Ape for the first time
***

Overarching goal:
- Stop the villain
	- Villain is either SO1 who wants to reclaim the Narthan ways or
	- Villain is big evil moon man and the hierarchy goes up
