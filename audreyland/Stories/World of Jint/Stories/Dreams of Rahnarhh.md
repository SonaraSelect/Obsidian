Brainstorm: [[Brainstorm Dreams of Rahnarhh]]

A story about [[Theon]] and [[Reja]] and their band of [[Royal Shamans]] as they journey into the ancient city [[Rahnarth]] to attempt the ritual to birth a [[New Gods|New God]] that's capable of obliterating the nation so everyone can ascend. They are intercepted by a [[TBD rebel group]] that believes there is still reason


What if we started with the gang camping in the outskirts of Rahnarth. The dream mention can also serve as a roadmap to how close the people are getting to the heart.

[[Reja]] is [[Theon]]'s bodyguard.


# Dreams of Rahnarth

[[Rahnarth]], the ancient City of the Valley. 

Ever since I first laid eyes on that ancient city, I have had nightmares. I still see myself standing on top of that cliff, hearing that faint hum emanating from that town. All other sounds completely silent, save the rustling wind. I still see the valley before me turn from sick, brown grass to the circular perimeter made almost exclusively of stone.

The shapes slowly rising from the ground. Watch towers, gates, structures seeming almost too dilapidated to be recognized as houses, all staring back at me. The buildings slowly growing taller and taller, suffocating each other separated only by stone streets trapped within their shadows. I see what I think to be figures moving in the dark, and at the heart of the city is a huge courtyard of stone surrounding an enormous tower that points up to the sky like a sickle TK. 

But only in my dreams do I see the colossal, putrid black orb above that tower. A rippling circle vibrating at its edges, leaking its contents onto the tower below almost piercing it with its needle-like tip. As I stare, that low rumbling hum begins to get louder, and my skull begins to ache.

"Major?"

Reja's voice jolted me awake. I wiped my eyes as that low hum poured into my ears. She was staring at me with her big, quizzical eyes.

"Something's wrong with the protection circle. I think something is near us," she continued, "we'll have to pack up and keep going deeper in."

"Are you sure? royal guy TK said we shouldn't be detecting any weird movements until we make it to the third layer."

Reja pursed her lips before speaking. "The ghosts should barely leave a mark on the circle. And, it's pointing at a disturbance behind us. Someone is following us into the city."

I sat up. Our expedition to Rahnarth was top secret, only the royal guard and a few other royal shamans in rank higher than me should know about this mission. While the city was bordering multiple nations within the continent.

"Alright then. Let's pack up the tent. We'll keep our guard up as we go in deeper," I said.

Reja raised an eyebrow and stared at me before slowly nodding in agreement. As my bodyguard on this expedition, it's a lot like her to want to find the enemy before they find us. But, I don't believe we could be running into trouble this soon. Again, no one else should know about this mission.

Reja picked up her sword and her other belongings from the tent. I gathered mine and after her, I stepped out of the tent.

We had set up camp on top of a small bridge between two of the stone buildings. Around us was a multilevel labyrinth of bridges and buildings reaching to up above. Before we made it to this position, Reja had pointed out that the sky had started to get more dark and hazy as we went on. At this point I could barely see a single star in the sky. In place of the sky was this ocean of black and gray, the colors wrestling with each other while shimmering above our eyes. Somehow, the moonlight still shone strongly on the pathways around us despite the moon being no where in sight.

This area had been an absolute nightmare to navigate. The ground had gotten lower and lower, being only visible in dark alleyways trapped in the shadows on the tall buildings. The buildings all had multiple bridges and staircases between the others on multiple levels. I peered down the bridge we were on and saw the bottom of the ravine like structure far below. I felt nauseous, and the gloomy hum of the city was not helping.

Reja picked up a small sphere with protruding cylinder knobs. It was a Manipulator, and she used it to fold the tent. Many people of our nation were gifted by the blood god [[Revnyris]] to have a type of blood that can manipulate the world without touch. This blood could still be used to transform the world even after it left one's body, and that was precisely how this "[[bloodform]]" tool was made.

As Reja twisted the small cylindrical handles on the device, the blood inside it would be activated and the movement of the cylinders would match the movement of the tent; The blood within and the target would be linked, and moving one would move the other, vice versa.

"Y'know Major, I get jealous of you shamans sometimes," Reja said, picking up the now folded cube that was the tent, "these tools are so helpful but they can only do so much. I bet it barely compares to having this stuff within your own blood." She tossed the cube to me so I could put it in my backpack.

I shrugged. "Maybe. But I could say the same to you with your heightened senses and regeneration, with your purple eyes and all."

Reja laughed. I walked to where the tent was and looked at the circle.

"Reja, the circle seems perfectly intact. Not a single sigil is glowing."

"It wasn't like that earlier." Reja said in a TK tone.

"Hmm." I thought to myself before dismissing the circle. "seems whoever's approaching us knows where we are, and they're skilled enough to erase their presence from the circle. That's a big problem."

Reja sighed and held her sword in her hand by the blade. The blade itself was actually quite dull, as it was a [[bloodform]] sword. The blood inside could be activated 'extend' the range of the blade by quite a long distance.

We began to walk toward the heart of the city, though we had to sidetrack a few times. Reja would run around to find a bridge that led to a building towards the heart of the city and then I would find a path towards it.

Some of the buildings still had something resembling furniture within them. One had a almost fully deteriorated wooden table that had splintered and collapsed onto the floor, with shattered ceramic plates scattered around it. I noticed what might have been silverware, too. All of the objects we found were covered in some sort of mass of... rock? It was as if they were partly coated in dense layers of mud. However, this thick material was only found mostly indoors. I was able to rub the material off one of the forks with my finger, but it smudged all over my thumb. The musky, earthy scent from the material was rather bothersome, and I regret that it now stuck to my hand.

Reja was the one to notice a peculiarity: only areas hidden from the moonlight had this material coated around them. She had a very good eye. Any spot in the dark was almost always coated in this substance, in large or small amounts.

As we walked and as she ran around to find a new path, I noticed she would constantly look behind us. Sometimes when we walked, we would hear another pair of footsteps. She would put a hand by my chest and we would stop dead in our tracks, and the second set of footsteps would stop. Maybe it was just an echo.

Eventually we made it to a gate. In fact, all the other bridges connecting to this wall of buildings also had gates.

"Well, we've made it to the third layer without encountering any guests." I said.

"I suppose we-" Reja stopped immediately, as her face darted to a bridge high up above.
