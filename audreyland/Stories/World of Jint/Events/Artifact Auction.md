Location in [[Kingdom of Jude]]

***
A black market auction for a [[Nartha|Narthan]] artifact is happening at [[Estopoles]]. Multiple factions are bidding on what to do with the artifact, and the gang is planning to steal the artifact, either for a quick buck or to make sure it doesn't land in the hands of criminals.

- What's the artifact?
	- Weapon?
- Which factions are showing up?
	- Corrupt government
	- Mafia
	- Inquisitor (grand entrance)
		- Why don't they kill the party?
	- Rebel group?
- What does the place look like?
	- Easier if above ground, maybe in some ball room or something like that. I'm thinking deception game
***
Gameplay:
- Phase 1: Infiltrate
	- Pretend to have a ticket? Then go stealth bts afterwards?
		- Can talk to NPCs
	- Sneak in completely?
	- Go in guns blazing (oh good fucking luck)
		- If they do this, the inquisitor arrives
- Phase 2: Steal
	- Special scene with the weapon doing something
		- Oh it would definitely cause an explosion or something when they touch it
			- Everyone is alerted
				- Inquisitor comes in once they're on the brink of their lives
- Phase 3: Escape
	- Thwarted by Inquisitor
