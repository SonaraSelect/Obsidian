## Caiaphen Caharmosian - he/they (Gwen)
Aasimar *High Elf*

Swashbuckler

"Charismatic, if anything goes wrong for them they wont do well. They're very fragile"

- Vain performer, wants more and more
- Wants to collect all these artifacts and things like that
- Outwardly doing it for financial gain, inwardly doing it for my god and to be closer to her (eldritch obsession)

- They're something evil underneath

"I recognize Golden Hands as the origin of Revnyris' worship, but the blood sacrifice is wasteful, taking worship of blood too far."

## Jamie
College of Souls bard -- Sho-Nue

Changeling
- Exotic monstrous race can change voice face and allat. 
- Outwardly doing it for money | Inwardly doing it to find out what's gonna happen

- Don't unearth the dead, respect the dead and let them rest


Would love to be able to get comfortable roleplaying the storytelling

- Talking with dead! Remember that!
