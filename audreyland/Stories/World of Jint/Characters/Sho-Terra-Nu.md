# Sho-Terra-Nu, God of Creation
*The Great All-Mother of Creation*

Sho-Terra-Nu, was the original god who created everything. The story goes that she was a being that existed before time, but one day she was cursed with the gift of creation. The power went out of control, and every single thing she imagined came to be.

She only created the [[Old Gods]], who serve as fundamental figureheads for core human traits. She imagined all parts of the universe, good and bad. She could not control her mind well, and the guilt for creating all the evil in the world drove her to insanity.

As the grew crazier her creations became more and more heinous, and [[Eneon]] and [[Revnyris]] teamed up together to slice her into a million pieces. Her fragmentation is why she has 3 names, or at least, 3 major known names. Each name represents a certain fragment of her, and the Sho, Terra, and Nue fragments are significantly stronger than the others, thus she is referred to by these.

## Brainstorm and Wishlist

- I want there to be some sort of dichotomy between the Nu rejectors and the Sho rejectors. Terra-Nue purists and Sho-Terra cultists.
