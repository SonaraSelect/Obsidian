# Revnyris, God of Blood and Glory

The strongest god created by [[Sho-Terra-Nu]], Revnyris is the God of Blood and Glory. She embodies violence, destruction, triumph, and it is believed by most nations for this to resemble life.

While more radical fundamentalist people believe her to resemble a lust for bloodshed, many others believe her to resemble effort and hard work. To those people she embodies the idea that if you put your blood sweat and tears into something, you too can experience her glory.

Revnyris' greatest gift to humanity was [[Blood Magic]], which is quite literally the ability to exert one's will to exert force onto the real world.
