A strict, almost fascist (probably fascit) empire that seeks total world domination. But is balanced out by **SOME CRITICAL THING** despite being so god damn strong.

I think the best way to handle the Gorne right now is to model them a bit after Viltrum. Maybe they're like some sort of 'super race' of people that are super powerful, smart, and naturally gifted that seek to control the entire world.

They can be balanced out by the fact that they simply don't have that many people... But I also wanted them to be controlling this colossal nation, I want to chase that vibe I get when I looked at Russia's shear size while playing hoi4.
