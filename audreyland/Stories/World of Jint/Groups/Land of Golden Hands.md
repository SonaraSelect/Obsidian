- What exactly happened with [[Longarms]] and [[Gideon]]
- Since [[Blood Magic]] is so dangerous, should they be a super authoritarian government? I mean I want their rule to be kind of oppressive, or at least for their populace to be this sort of hyper religious fanatics that follow these extreme rules. Need to research Christian Perfectionism
# Land of Golden Hands

They follow [[Gideon]]'s teachings

Biggest follower of [[Revnyris]] and leading innovators in [[Blood Magic]]
