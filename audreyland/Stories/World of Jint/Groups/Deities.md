- THERE ARE NO MORAL GODS. THEY ARE ALL MORALLY AMBIGIOUS
- Should each old god have their own sect of magic? Major ones have entire schools, while minor ones just have subsects and incantations?

Old Gods were created by STN, while the New Gods were created by the Nartha in Rahnarth. But not everybody knows that last part yet.

The old golds are like people, the new gods and ascended ones are like energies and ideas

# Old Gods
## Major Old Gods
Each nation typically believes in only one god as the benevolent major one. The rest are usually seen as terribly evil or harmful to society as a whole.

[[Sho-Terra-Nu]] - God of Creation and Imagination.
[[Revnyris]] - God of Blood and Glory. Represents the core human drive to do difficult things to find purpose.
[[Eneon]] - God of Hunger. Represents the core drive for more
[[Lune]] - God of Insanity; Moon Diet.
[[Cisneros]] - ???

### Minor Old Gods
The minor old gods are called "Lights."

[[Delenne]] - Light of Art. God representing man kinds desire for connections with others
[[Symeon]] - Light of Devotion. Represents dedication as a core component of hope
[[Archimeral]] - Light of trickery, servant of [[Lune]]
[[Armeleon]] - Light of Dark, kind of like Prometheus! He granted [[Gideon]] the chance to ascend.

The old gods have existed long before time, having been created by the original [[Sho-Terra-Nu]].

# New Gods
Gods that were created in [[Rahnarth]]. Unlike the Old Gods, they don't resemble core drives but rather can represent much broader ideas. The God of Ascendance, God of Prosperity, God of Peace. All these things. Think of them as extremely powerful boons that can bring certain eras to the world
## [[Demigods]]

[[Gideon]] -
