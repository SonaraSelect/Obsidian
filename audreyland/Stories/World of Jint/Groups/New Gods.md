Gods that were created in [[Rahnarth]]. Unlike the Old God's, they don't resemble core drives but rather can represent much broader ideas. The God of Ascendance, God of Prosperity, God of Peace. All these things. Think of them as extremely powerful boons that can bring certain eras to the world

## New Gods

[[????]] - the God Killer (maybe dont do this idea, the old gods killed STN together)
