The ancient predecessors who one controlled a central part of the world. They existed during a time when the influence of the gods on man was much stronger, and they created numerous miracle technologies from magic.

The Nartha went extinct when they had created too many gods in the capitol City of the Valley, [[Rahnarth]]. This location is 'the closest to the gods' and thus they build a megastructure that converts human souls into singular gods.

This reaction leaves behind an awful byproduct, the [[Narthic Rot]], which is what consumed all of the city and eventually led to the fall of the Nartha.
