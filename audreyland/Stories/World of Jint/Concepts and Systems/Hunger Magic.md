A type of [[Magic (General)|Magic]] that centers around energizing and empowering oneself by consuming the world around you. [[Eneon]] is patron to this sect.

My favorite example of this magic is the [[Bite of Eneon]] spell that allows the wielder to call on Eneon to devour an object, leaving a perfect circular hole.

There are also spells that strengthen someone, there are rituals where people consume food and other people, etc. to heal or even transform themselves.
