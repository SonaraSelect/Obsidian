## Brainstorming
- Estopoles is a crime hotspot city with mostly corrupt police and tons of illegal markets. People sell all kinds of stuff here, from sex to drugs to weapons to other contraband. There's also a lot of kowloon style establishments where doctors who lost their license or people who just want to run their own shops without paying taxes come here to pursue their dreams without government needs.
