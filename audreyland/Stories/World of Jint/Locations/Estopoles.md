# Estopoles
*The Standing City on the Water*

Estopoles, the City on the Water: A marvel of engineering made with the nigh forgotten old magic of the Sho people. It is a supermassive city built above an inner sea (like the Mediterranean), its central structures not dissimilar to an oil rig. The city is certainly not entirely made of metal, though. Once you're inside it really feels like you're still on land, with there being lots of greenery where appropriate and stone roads as normal. The huge metal frames of the megastructure are entirely hidden from those inside the city. The city is in the center of a strait similar to Gibraltar, and this makes the area a complete trade hotspot.

Legal goods come in by boat from around the kingdom (and other nations) most often, docking below the city, with there being stairways and structures to efficiently carry their goods up the main areas of the city. The boat docks are mainly located in the south, which is well policed like most of the city, so most illegal goods do not come in through here.

The northern region of Estopoles is notoriously crime ridden (think of it as significantly worse East Cleveland) where the policing is completely corrupt and criminal establishments live out in broad daylight. The crime lords here have gotten so powerful that the government has decided to simply let them run the area themselves as it would cost too many resources to detain all of them. Here various factions run rampant, see the Northern Estopoles section.

There are three central bridges connecting Estopoles to the land nearby: a northern bridge, titled Masalis Bridge (notable), a southwest bridge, and a southeast bridge. Again, the northern bridge is not policed at all (and is the central trade route for all crime), while the southern bridges are safe and well policed.

## Architecture

The architecture is split into two parts. The old era and new area structures. The city is 90% new era structures at this point, as clearly much of the smaller buildings within the city have not survived during the thousands of years of its existence. The all new area structure regions look extremely similar to this real world location https://maps.app.goo.gl/VbnuPzt4agTEbs7n8 (feel free to walk around in 360 view), with lots of small elevation changes within the wide labyrinth of pedestrian dominated roads between buildings all bunched together.

There is also a massive tunnel network (similar to the french catacombs, with large rooms here and there) underneath the main level, where a lot of illegal things happen (many illegal establishments that aren't in the north will be hidden away in the tunnel systems, many gang skirmishes happen over tunnel control disputes). Also, some extremely poor people (often homeless) make places for themselves within the dark tunnel systems.

### The Old Structures
The Sho people did leave some buildings behind. There are gigantic monoliths, monuments, churches of Sho, and even skyscrapers within the building. While there is no old magic remaining to power the 'elevator' systems of these gargantuan buildings, they are mainly uninhabited. What lies in the upper levels of these forgotten levels is a mystery. Some say there are ancient monsters locked away near the top.
## Northern Estopoles
*Crime Central - if you're not from the North, you may stop reading after the first paragraph*

To those who don't live in the north, it is an awful, morally bankrupt, devilish area filled to the brim with crooks and people ready to mug you- Where people have sex with hookers and do drugs on the streets in broad daylight; Where people go to gamble and possibly toss their lives into the hands of ruthless criminal factions.

But to those who live there, they know this isn't exactly true. Well, some of it does happen, but there's more to the area. For those not aggressively causing crime, there are very tight knit communities in the different neighborhoods. The people here police themselves and sometimes that leads to justice that the government wouldn't bother to serve. The government doesn't tax anything here, and that allows a lot of people to run businesses they wouldn't be able to run otherwise, and when you're on the good side of the gang leaders of your neighborhood, you don't have to pay them very much either.

In some areas the gangs help people of their own religion. The Crimson Eyes, for example, take very decent care of the Nyrisan neighborhoods in their territories.

All the crime factions in northern Estopoles are present in the other areas, but I will list them here:

- [[Watchers Society]] - a HUGE Delennite secret society (majorly present around all of the kingdom) that collects, steals, and sometimes leaks confidential information about, well, everything. They're kinda like "the watchers" of the Kingdom of Jude. Many conspiracists believe they are secretly puppeting the king. They run a sizeable portion of Northern Estopoles, and in all truth the average person has no idea what they do. They do use up a lot of buildings, but no average person is allowed in and their territories are heavily guarded. This and the fact they don't badger the everyday people living around makes their areas the most pleasurable places to live in the north. They also have a Grand Library where a bunch of illegal books are kept, and this library is open to the public at select hours. They also run schools in new magic and have some sort of secret academy called [[Fairfax Academy]] few know about.
- [[Crimson Eyes]] - A very large Nyrisian mafia (majorly present around the northeastern areas of the kingdom) that smuggles goods from foreign lands into Jude. They run famous 'Pleasure Parlors' which are establishments dedicated to varying levels of drugs, alcohol, gambling, prostitution, and, most importantly, pit fights. The pit fights are extremely popular with the Nyrisan and Enite people in the area, and at the higher levels the fights can be extremely hardcore with people dying in some cases. Though, any deaths in the pit usually start a resulting mini gang war. One notable pleasure house is called "the [[Bitches Brew]]," which focuses on pit fights, gambling, and drugs & alcohol with minimal prostitution. Lots of aspiring pit fighters start their careers here, if they can handle the heat.
- the [[Exurge]] - A medium size Nyrisan mafia that competes with the Crimson Eyes in the black market. The Exurge has a fair amount of turf in the north, but undeniably less than the Crimson Eyes. They make a name for themselves by being the best drug lords in the region, the only area where they outclass the Crimson Eyes. They don't have grand Pleasure Parlors like their biggest competitor, but instead they have a bunch of tavern-like buildings dedicated to similar things. One notable tavern is [[the Oracle]] where people can inhale an illegal drug that's said to let you prophesize the future, but only for a few moments.
- the [[Rogues Guild]] - a huge Emeian guild of rogues. Does it exist? Probably. If you know about the rogues guild, one of them has probably stolen from you. But only the rogues *really* know about the rogues guild. You don't know much about what goes on in there, do you? But the rogues, *they know*, and they laugh at you for not knowing. *The rogues guild is everywhere,* but you can't find a trace of them no matter how hard you look. Wait... do they really exist? Heh. Sucker. Only *a rogue* would know. 
- [[Forever]] - A small gang of mercenary Enites looking to get paid for wreaking havoc. Notable members include [[Preacher]], a belligerent alcoholic most often found drunkenly badgering non Enite passersby's on the street when not in battle (he also offers apprenticeships and lessons in Enite history), [[Listener]], a wise man who is the one to go to when hiring Forever, and [[Blitzer]], an extremely notorious pit fighter at [[Bitches Brew]] who has killed 5 people mid fight (highest count out of anyone) and has started some gang wars because of it- also he's most often found getting extremely high in Exurge taverns (he's one of the few people who can predict other people's futures at [[the Oracle]]).
- Rumored Nue Faction - rumors have it there's a small fanatical Nuite gang going around and resurrecting the dead for mischievous reasons.
- There are more gangs that are not mentioned
### Political Climate in the North
Usually the different gangs stay in their lane, though Forever and the alleged Rogues Guild cause the most commotion, often sparking conflicts between the factions, the former doing it often because they are paid to, although both will instigate for selfish means. 

Of course the Crimson Eyes and the Exurge are rivals, although they seldom fight- they usually fight by more indirect means like trying competing for customers in their black markets and starving each others trade routes in various ways (though both can climax into a skirmish or war).

The Exurge used to be much larger, but recently they bit off more than they could chew when they attacked and killed numerous Crimson Eyes and Watchers Society smugglers, inciting a large gang war (you do NOT want to mess with the Watchers Society). This was an extremely, extremely stupid decision. The Exurge claimed that the assailant were operatives that went rogue for unknown reasons but the other gangs didn't buy it. In the end the Exurge suffered heavy casualties and their turf was greatly reduced.
