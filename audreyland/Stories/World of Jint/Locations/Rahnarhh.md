# Rahnarhh, City of the Valley

The ancient city! This city has been around for a very long time, left behind by [[ancient predecessors]]. Every one thousand years or so (maybe longer), the stars align and the city can be used to create a god.

What did [[New Gods]] did the [[ancient predecessors]] create? Are they related to the [[Gorne Empire]]? Did they leave anything else behind?
