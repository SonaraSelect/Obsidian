## Brainstorming



# Rahnarth, City of the Valley

The ancient city! This city has been around for a very long time, left behind by [[Nartha]]. Every one thousand years or so (maybe longer), the stars align and the city can be used to create a god.

What did [[New Gods]] did [[Nartha]] create? Are they related to the [[Gorne Empire]]? Did they leave anything else behind?

## Brainstorm and Wishlist

- What is the hum? Is it like some sort of magical field that preserves everything or protects you from something? Maybe the heart is so dangerous with the direct connection to the gods that the surrounding area needs to be constantly 'decontaminated' by the hum
- What happened to the city? Did they create an evil god that led to the destruction of the nation in a near extinction that led to everything having to be rebuilt.
- Is [[Gideon]] actually a heretic? A self made god who sacrificed his tribe of [[Longarms]] to ascend himself into the divine? Maybe something went wrong with this and he was never fully immortalized? 

- Snowing upside down, the snow is slowly growing and its particles are slowly ripped off and moved upwards. You do NOT want to leave crates or large surface area things on the snow, here there are tons of floating structures, all with pointed bottoms to move the snow off of them (almost looks as if they are standing on needles)

## Layers of the city

- Figure out what to do with the upside down snow
### Layer 1 - The Outskirts

The outskirts, occasional buildings surrounded by dead grass and dying shrubbery. No trees present, the land is super flat and you can see pretty far ahead in multiple directions. 

At the border there are tons of different dilapidated gates and walls at the city.
### Layer 2 - The Buildings

The labyrinth of buildings begins. Here there are lots of variations in altitude, many buildings and staircases interwoven together going up and down. Here the structures are more focused on a handful of upper and lower levels, connecting the buildings from 1B to 3F style heights. **THERE ARE LOTS AND LOTS OF ALTARS TO THE GODS, SOME EVEN UNKNOWN TO THE CURRENT NATIONS**. Maybe there are also tons of effigies, some in torture objects, and also lots of petrified people, Pompei style?

At the border the hum suddenly gets considerably louder and dimmer, and if you really focus you can hear whispers around. Maybe there's also a special landmark of a petrified person who fell onto the ground directly on the border. Their legs are a wispy, swaying shadow that's trying to leave the petrified ash.
### Layer 3 - The Towers

Things stop getting lonely here. There are plenty of occasional shadow figures walking around, much like Fear and Hunger. There are still some remaining monsters, golems, and many more artifacts. If anyone is ever to loot the city, this is where they go, and they never go any further. The sky becomes a radiant, piercing unblinking eye, always following you.

Now the altitude changes of the city are much much starker, like a 6B to 4F type of thing. The pathways between everything are extremely convoluted and it's very easy to get lost.

At the border, the skyscrapers and die down and everything starts to level out. A giant expansive walled courtyard can be visible. This courtyard is The Heart. Right at the border the hum gets deafeningly loud.
### Layer 4 - The Heart

After crossing the gats the hum stops immediately, giving way to an uncanny silence. Any sounds made by people within are also reduced, you'd have to yell to say anything someone a few meters away.

Perhaps there are some sort of guardians that form from rubble on the ground, or something like that. Who knows.

At the center is the tower, and inside you can sacrifice someone (or multiple people) when the stars align to begin the [[birthpot of the gods]].
## Location

Located between the many nations of the continent.
