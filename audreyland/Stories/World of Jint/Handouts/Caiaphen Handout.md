You are an up and coming famous performer, based in the massive city of [[Estopoles]].

You've toured around the Kingdom of Jude a few times, although you haven't had the budget to go across the kingdom completely, of course (it's so huge). But besides Estopoles you've performed in [[Ninasara]], a nearby smaller city to the west of Estopoles, and [[Hudine]], a wide but ultimately small rural town south of Estopoles.

In [[Ninasara]] something bad happened. Your manager, [[Eurgen]] booked an inn at the wrong area and at the end of the day you were forced to stay in some dingy no name place called [[Krillothy's Chalamei]]. It was awful, dirty, smelly, and super loud with various men taking prostitutes here at night. After the concert when you headed back to your room at the inn you came to an open door, with a dwarf in a highly eccentric green coat scurrying out of it, carrying something very valuable to you (you choose what it is). You still curse your manager for this happening to this very day. That one thing was super valuable! Either for personal or monetary reasons.

But the people seem to like you and the music you make. Many popular celebrities are often Nyrisan, as they're always so drawn to being spectacular, but that doesn't mean that there are people that hate you. Every concert there are a some Nuites that try to throw tomatoes on stage, and as you walk out of the premises they often yell and try to call you slurs, saying your Nyrisan ways proclaim a false god and an even falser, shallow way of life. How that impacts you is up to you. Your manager tries to take care of this, but some of them slip through.

Your manager is a pretty decent guy. He's a bit stiff usually but when he needs to be he can be extremely charismatic, and his ways have gotten you into some really high profile concerts in Estopoles- ones that are out of your league.

But somethings a bit weird. Since the incident with the dwarven thief in Ninasara, you notice minor things of yours go missing from time to time. You don't quite know why. What else you think of it is up to you. 

But there is much more to say about your performing career. Some other things you know

- You've performed at at least 5 different venues in Estopoles
- Northern Estopoles is a very crime ridden region with corrupt police. Think of it as the east cleveland of the area.
- If you've performed there, some crazy shit has happened, likely with one of these gangs
- You make a decent amount of money
