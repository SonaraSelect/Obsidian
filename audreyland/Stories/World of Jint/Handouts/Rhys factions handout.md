You are a bouncer/bruiser within the lower middle level of the [[Crimson Eyes]] mafia. The Crimson Eyes are a group, not entirely malevolent, that both illegally move contraband between nations and cities as well as host illegal establishments called "Pleasure Parlors," which each feature various amounts of gambling, drugs and alcohol, prostitution, and pit fights. The pit fights in [[Estopoles]]' Pleasure Parlors are especially popular.

You got into this business by YOU CHOOSE. Perhaps you started out as a pit fighter, and when you finally beat that one terrible rival of yours (choose name and religion), you attracted the attention of the higher ups in the Crimson Eyes and they started using you as muscle.

Within the Eyes you mainly act as a bouncer for a specific Pleasure Parlor called the [[Bitches Brew]], located in northern Estopoles. You also escort VIPs around Northern Estopoles (its dangerous there). This establishment focuses most of gambling, drugs, alcohol, and pit fights, with significantly less prostitution than the others. Here you watch the door, break up fights, escort people out of the bar, etc.

One notable person you come across often times while working here is Archibald, the self titled "dashing rogue." He's like the joker to your batman. He's always getting into trouble at Bitches Brew by cheating at gambling in increasingly clever ways, as well as getting so drunk/inebriated that he has to be thrown out every night he shows up. You might hate him, but maybe it's almost become fun to handle his madness when you work. That's for you to decide.

You don't only stop commotion at the Bitches Brew, however. Northern Estopoles has the most corrupt police in the region so the gangs and mafias can get away with a lot (much like having this pleasure parlor in plain sight), but that means gang wars happen often.

Rivaling Nyrisan mafias, such as the Exurge, often try to siege the building and steal the drugs and money within. When that happens, you're on the frontlines to help fight them off. Maybe a notable member (name of your choosing) from the Exurge injured you in a way of your choosing during one of these skirmishes. 

You also sometimes fight of the Enite mercenary group called Forever, which is filled with strange death-craving fanatics who name themselves strange things. Every time Forever shows up at the door, there's always this one man with them named Crusher, who seems to be your rival from that group.

You aren't just 'some bouncer,' though. Out of the 3 bouncers in charge at Bitches Brew you're one of them. You report to [[Cydafeld]], who might not be the owner of the parlor, but is somewhere close to it in the chain of command. You don't know much about your superiors, the mafia keeps it ambigious.
