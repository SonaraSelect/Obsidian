You are a Royal Archeologist. That's a very big title- it's very hard to find work that is close to the king and any occupation with the 'royal' title almost always means working close to secrets of the kingdom- secrets that must remain secret by all means. 

Regarding the recent appearance of this mysterious "City of the Valley," surfacing under Mt. Olympus' unforeseen collapse, you know a few things:

There was something off about the top of the mountain. You weren't high ranking enough to be assigned on expeditions to the area, but you've talked with plenty of your coworkers who have, and something strange has happened to all of them. Some have lost parts of their memories (curiously enough all would forget about the gods they worshipped), some gone blind or deaf or, strangely, unable to feel touch, some have returned with new senses (one man developed some sort of feeling of extreme pain and/or terror when standing within exact proximities to old shrines), some developing mixed senses (one woman reported only being able to "see sounds" and "hear her normal vision"), some peoples eye colors changing to strange shades, etc. 

Every person who has had children after returning from an expedition to the top have reported their children seeming strange, often having fur when they shouldn't, or none when they should, also having misshapen body parts with strange proportions- one child had two arms sprouting from one elbow, both of different lengths, with his other arm having being one from an entirely different race.

From your own expeditions there you have always felt a strange, uneasy feeling while on the mountain. A feeling that something ancient; something timeless is laying there dead waiting to be revived. Even the natural structures feel uncanny, your senses telling you there is something artificial about them.

Your most kept secret is that during your first expedition to the middle altitude of the mountain, you got lost from the group and stumbled upon an ancient structure, some sort of man(?)-made altar built upon a wide, flat foundation. This structure matched not a single architectural style out of all the ancient structures you've studied (and you've studied *a lot*). In the center there was an opening to a staircase descending lower into the ground, and right when you were about to investigate it you heard your group from afar. You ran to them, and after retracing your steps to lead them to your discovery, you returned to nothing- even though surrounding natural landmarks showed you were at the exact same spot. 

Ever since something has been wrong with your magic. It feels slightly painful to cast spells. There's always a slight burning sensation on your fingertips, as if you quickly dipped them in weak acid. You can shrug it off easily, but it unsettles you nevertheless.

Maybe the crumbling of that cursed mountain surprised you. Maybe it didn't, that's for you to decide. But you've always felt as if there was something *more* there, and the mountain was silently calling your name, promising to give you everything you've ever dreamed.

What does surprise you is that after the event, every royal archeologist has been ordered to stay as far away from the city as possible. The higher ups announced that all the still able-bodied people who ran expeditions to the peak of the mountain are to be detained, and you have a hunch that you're coming next. So you're partially defecting, at least for now. Is the government hiding something?

You came to the streets of Northern Estopoles to find out more about the city. You know that the Nyrisan mafias in this region have a lot of power and a lot of ways to access the city. You know the Delennite Watcher's Society may have some leads in their hidden libraries. In fact, you know that there are currently artifacts from the City of the Valley being traded within the region... and that just might be your biggest lead yet while it's still to hot to go to the valley directly, given your direct royal orders not to.

And one more thing. You're almost sure you're being watched. Or is that just that wicked city's eye scrying on you?
