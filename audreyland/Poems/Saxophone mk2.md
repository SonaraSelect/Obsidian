I stare at that black case, waiting
for excitement to come back to me.

I see its bland white letters over the mass of shadow,
its dull reflection of light. It lies there dead.
Painted in same color all over; the same story, 
told over and over.

But then something changes.

Finally, that black case turns into a wrapped gift
with its straps splayed on the ground like ribbons
waiting to be opened

It jumps into my arms.
With a quick zip, its shine greets me
Capturing me with its dark silver glow
and golden accents.

It transforms me. Turning
my low, raspy, uncertain voice
into something loud and confident.

Like a big silver coat,
wrapped around me
with its cushiony, fuzzy insides
and gold lining all around.

With this coat I sing in the basement,
the coat glowing bright with joy,
with sadness, anger, anticipation.

Each feeling
a different color painted onto the walls by my light.
Red, green, blue, purple


I sit in my glistening cavern,
accompanied by only my echoes
and the smooth pearl keys
click clacking underneath my fingers.

Overjoyed, I forget I sing the same song
over and over again. Unknowingly I silently hope the melody 
would offer me something, anything new.

But nothing new ever comes.

The silver coat starts to feel tight, constricting
and the shiny white keys start to feel slippery.
The colors scattered across the walls seem gaudy.

I’m tired of seeing purple after the twelfth time.

So I take it off me. The room grows dim and quiet; Bland.
I put that thing back in its case,
once again a dark box I’d rather not open

until excitement comes back to me
