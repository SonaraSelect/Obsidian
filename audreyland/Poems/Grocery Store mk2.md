Everything is a blur as I stumble into the grocery store.

But still, I see a police officer
of black and blue give me
a nod, pistol holstered,

and a gunshot wound, flash on my dark
thigh. I see an apple,
ripe with white stretch marks
and green blemishes
on its red body.

The devil-
's color sits there, laughing,
as I run away, banishing myself
from the garden of fruit.

Out of breath, I see the crowd stare.
Their faces strained and distorted, unmoving.
Am I in a dream?
Their whispering rings in my head,
like nails on the chalkboard of my skull.
The noise scatters my thoughts,
each turning into a glowing firefly, fleeing
from my head.

Head emptying, I chase after them,
unable to catch a single one;
But I don't give up.

I follow the fireflies, maybe they're guiding me
to their silent safe haven. 
To their land full of colors, of light green leaves,
all a different hue. Thin orange stalks, 
ringed with little dips. Curved yellow tubes,
joined at a green tip. I see a rainbow of colors, 
dripping in the cool mist amongst the fireflies.
One thought sticks: this is the Garden of Eden.

I am back at long last.
I smile, my sins must have been absolved,
my mistakes forgiven. I become entranced
by the firefly's streaks of flashing lights.

The whole store a phantasm of dots,
bobbing up and down, fading in and out
as they float through the air.

One dot dances about a carrot before landing.
As it paints its dull greenish-yellow glow onto the orange vegetable,
I can taste its earthy crunch in my empty mouth.
