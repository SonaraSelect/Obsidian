In the dark and musty basement 
it sits there, waiting.

It sits there, unmoving.
A black case against an ugly yellow wall.
White letters marking its mass of shadow
and dull reflection of the dim light.
Its black vortex begins to suck me in.

*Will things be different this time?*

Instead, I start to see a wrapped gift,
with its straps splayed on the ground like ribbons,
waiting to be opened.

It jumps into my arms, and it opens with a zip,

Capturing me with its dark silver glow
and golden accents.

Blowing into its mouthpiece, my voice transforms,
and I forget how cold it was down here.
I finally feel warm.

Like a big silver coat 
is wrapped around me,
with its cushiony, fuzzy insides
and gold lining all around.

I begin to play,
the smooth pearl keys
click clacking underneath my fingers.

The coat wrapping around me tighter.

I play a line,
and I can feel the room glowing with each note.
A different color for every emotion,
red, green, purple, blue.

Overjoyed, I sing the same song over again.
The same set of colors,
once, twice, three times
again and again.

Silently, I hope
to find a new melody,
but as I look it slips between my fingers.
They're too stiff to play something new.

The colors turn gaudy.
The coat starts to tighten around me more,
digging into my skin,
and the shiny white keys start to feel slippery.

Iâ€™m tired of seeing purple after the twelfth time.

So I rip the coat off of me,
throw that *thing* back into its case.
Now a dark box I'd rather not open,

Until excitement comes back to me.
