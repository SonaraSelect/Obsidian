When excitement comes back to me
that black case turns into a wrapped gift
with its straps splayed on the ground like ribbons
waiting to be opened

With a quick zip, its shine greets me

Captured by its dark silver glow
and golden accents,

my low, raspy, uncertain voice turns
into something loud and confident

like a big silver coat,
wrapped around me
with cushiony, fuzzy insides
and gold lining all around

With this coat I sing in the basement
each note changing its color
Red, green, blue, purple
a dazzling, sparkling thing

There, I’m accompanied by only my echoes
and the smooth pearl keys
click clacking underneath my fingers

But soon I’ve worn every color
Purple seems gaudy after the 10th time

I don’t know what color to wear next
the coat starts to feel tight, constricting
and the shiny white keys start to feel slippery

So I take it off
put that thing back in its case
now a dark box I’d rather not open

until excitement comes back to me
