I didn't even remember how I got here.
The entrance faces me, and I walk in.

But still, I see a police officer
of black and blue give me
a nod, pistol holstered,

and a gunshot wound, flash on my dark
thigh. I shake my head and stumble forward. I see an apple,
ripe with white stretch marks
and green blemishes
on its red body.

The devil-
's color sits there, laughing,
as I run away, banishing myself
from the garden of fruit.
No matter what I do I can't shake it off.

Trying to calm myself down, I see the crowd stare.
There eyes bobbing left and right, up and down on their faces.
Is this just a bad dream?
They whisper to each other, but I hear it loud and clear.
Too loud, like nails on the chalkboard of my skull.
My breathing quickens, and my thoughts start to flee
each turning into a glowing firefly, all pouring
out of my ears.

My mind going numb, I chase them,
trying to regain my thoughts. It's useless,
but I don't give up.

I follow the fireflies, perhaps they're guiding me
to their silent safe haven.
To their land full of colors, of light green leaves,
all a different hue. Thin orange stalks, 
ringed with little dips. Curved yellow tubes,
joined at a green tip. I see a rainbow of colors, 
dripping in the cool mist amongst the fireflies.
One thought sticks: this is the Garden of Eden.

I am back.
Maybe God is listening to my prayers, maybe he wants to forgive
me. Maybe he understands my hardships,
unlike the people watching from afar.

But I don't want to think about them. I focus
on the firefly's streaks of flashing lights.

The whole store a phantasm of dots,
bobbing up and down, fading in and out
as they float through the air.

One dot dances about a carrot before landing.
As it paints its dull greenish-yellow glow onto the orange vegetable,
I can taste its earthy crunch in my empty mouth.
I didn't realize I was so hungry.

Maybe that's why I left home.
