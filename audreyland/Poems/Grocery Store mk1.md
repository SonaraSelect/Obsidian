I see a police officer
of black and blue give me
a nod, pistol holstered,

and a gunshot
wound, on my dark
thigh. I see an apple,
ripe with white stretch marks
and green blemishes
on its red body.

I gasp at the devil-
‘s color. As I stare,
the red lines running along my sleeve
burn hot, touching the depths
of hell, branding my skin.

I see the crowd stare. Too many voices,
each voice spawning the apple’s serpent
that burrows through my ear
into my head, sucking and gnawing
on my skull. A deafening scratching sound
from the inside of tooth and bone.

My thoughts swirl in my head as they transform
into fireflies. Flying out my ears freely, to escape
the noise. I chase them, unable to catch a single one;
Not even one thought can stay in my skull
I’m unable to think to stop chasing. 

I follow the fireflies to their silent safe haven. 
To a land full of colors: of light green leaves,
all a different hue. Thin orange stalks, 
ringed with little dips. Curved yellow tubes,
joined at a green tip. I see a rainbow of colors, 
dripping in the cool mist amongst the fireflies.
One thought sticks: this is the garden of eden.

Standing there, I’m simply
entranced by the firefly’s streaks of flashing lights

The whole store a fantasm of dots,
bobbing up and down, fading in and out
as they float through the air. 

One dot dances about a carrot before landing.
As it paints its dull greenish-yellow glow onto the orange vegetable,
I can taste its earthy crunch in my empty mouth.
