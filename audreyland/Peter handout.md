# Adoration of the All Devouring
*With life comes death, and also the need to devour. To satiate. In order to truly exist.*

Eneon, dearest, Eneon. May your throne of thorns uplift you in all your glory. Let your glowing eyes shine in the shadows of night. I see you watching patiently from the void, waiting for your time- though all time yours- to pass.

And I adore it, Eneon. My hands are for bringing worthy creatures to your jaws. My eyes are for seeing your gifts thrusted upon me. My skin is for feeling the tease of a loving embrace; the quiet buzz of your void's call.

Throughout all my acts I see you watching over us, examining, O patient one, keeper of time. My soul is set on fire, your gracious time slowly burning it away, slowly encompassing it within the grasp of your void, until my final hour where I may find repose in the cradle of your jaws.

O jagged one, unlike the others. I adore your difference. Your need to devour, like us. Your teeth, jaw, mouth, and temperance. Truly you are the one whose image is closest to ours, the others are all false: The bloody one who does not bleed, the severed one who does none but think; The Lightly ones who do nothing but pretend as gods over their puny domains. To you they are nothing. Only prey. Yet you keep time even for them, consuming their fractured, weak, sickly parts.

Keeper of all verses, I wish that one day you may suck my bones dry and clean me of this flesh in your most spectacular way. And for this I will make myself prepared, O hungry one, you. I will ripen the fruit of my flesh, I will embrace the wearing grasp of time, and I will clasp my hands in joy once I find the perfect entrance to your jaws in good time.

See you that I care not to become another vestige, as the heathens call it? I know your truth. Your glory of truth: that once I am consumed I may transcend this mortal coil, and in divine liberation become a part of your strength, a piece of an all powerful god. True glory is to give it all to become one with you. I know those jaws, Eneon. I know you will consume all in good time, I know this, O patient one.

And it is my honor to come first.
