# GUARDS Method

The GUARDS method is a list of 6 vital components of every living breathing fantasy town!


## Government Buildings

Every place needs a way to govern itself! This can also include police and fireman buildings, courts, etc.
## Underground Activities

>Every town needs a place where you can talk to a shadow character out of the eye of the law!
## Altars

Always nice to have a place where the locals worship the divine. Can be a spot to learn about the gods the people worship.
## Resources

Every town offers at least something! Could be trade goods or something similar
## Defenses

Always has to be some sort of defense! Guards, police, etc.
## Social hubs

Every town has bars and similar locations for people to meet up!
