### Inspiration Tracking: Mood boards

List of art, music, and texts of inspirations!! Seems this could also be used for plotting!

You can right click to make those little post-it notes, and then it can actually be really easy to right click again to turn them into their own proper note (turn into file)


## Plotting: Kanban boards

You can have columns next to each other that continuously go down. Great for listing scenes. I installed a plugin that handles this

## Writing the Story Chapter by Chapter

Chapters go into their own notes





## My Ideas

- Make a folder for each **chapter**, each gets its own note
- Make a folder for all the **characters**, each gets their own note
- Make a folder for all the **locations**, each getting its own note
