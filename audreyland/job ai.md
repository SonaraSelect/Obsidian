# Resume Bullet Points


You are an expert resume writer with 20 years of experience.
Here's a bullet point I have in my resume. No action needed for now, if you understand please respond with "Yes."

**Optional:** I don't know how my success was measured. Please give me suggestions where and how I can add quantifiable and measurable metrics in this bullet point.


Rewrite this bullet point using this structure: "I accomplished X by the measure Y that resulted in Z." For example, "I lowered hospital mortality rates by 10% by educating nurses in new protocols which translates to 200 lives saved per year."
Use compelling language and keep the bullet point within 50 words.
