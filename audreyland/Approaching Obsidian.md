### General Use

Ctrl + O opens your search bar, if it doesn't exist it will make the note
Ctrl + T adds the general template, be sure to list source material in references

Notes look like ~250 words each, maybe paste in a quote that inspired you and expand on that with your wordcount. Each individual take away should be its own note

(Title should be your takeaway!)

Status: used to write # baby, # child, or # adult and also # quote
- Baby - Needs the most attention
- Child - Getting there
- Adult - Matured idea and fully thought out
- Quote - things with quotes ig?

Tags: Yes. But don't be too vague, don't be too specific. Vague is for the indexes, tags are about relating things. Just think **"Will I ever use this tag again?** Keep them related to your interests!
4-5 tags per page please.

Keep notes easier to read!

## Rough Notes

Reminders, 'rough notes'

Things you don't want to get, to do lists and things you might want to research further. This is a lot like the top sections of the RTVTL backup server

## Source Material

Storing the critical information from things that you learn. Oddy divides this folder into articles, books, videos, etc.

He leaves unsorted notes on the bottom; Things he leaves unfinished

**Link to Source Material in References!!**
## Tags

Basic network management. ALL tags go here

## Indexes

"PoP's" that start to sort all the tags.

Ex: the has a "learning" index that has tooons of links, and all the links are categorized under various subsections like 'how to learn' 'psychological effects of learning' 'learning strategies' etc.

## Template

Just holds your template

## Main Notes

This is where the magic happens!
