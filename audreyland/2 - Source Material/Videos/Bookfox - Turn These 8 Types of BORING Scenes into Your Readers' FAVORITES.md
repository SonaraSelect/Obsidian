# Bookfox - Turn These 8 Types of BORING Scenes into Your Readers' FAVORITES

 **8 ways to strengthen mundane scenes:**
- How to add impending danger
- Adding small obstacles when there are none
- Where to place backstory
# Scenes moving characters across locations

- **Create some sense of danger while the character is on their journey.** Maybe someone is following them, maybe they're just paranoid about being followed. It's all about adding an imminent threat as they travel
- Use this space to **expose an important idea of the characters!** Maybe they reveal something strange they think strongly about in conversation, or they have some epiphany!

# Scene setting (describing scenes)

- Remember the act of balancing between **static description** and **dynamic descriptions**.
- Static description does not involve the character while dynamic description while in dynamic description the scene interacts with the character

"When she stepped off the curb, a taxi running a red light honked at her and swerved."

"The hotdog vendor stared too long at her and she pulled her coat tighter."

- Try to keep the ratio of more dynamic than static description

# Mundane, everyday scenes

- Add microconflict: like the waiter at a restaurant is fussy and disagreeable, or some other small barrier
- Expand on characters: How can this mundane scene tell us something new about the character(s)

# Backstories

- Think of firewatch, the uses dramatic action and conflict. We basically get to live a bite sized, condensed version of the character's past where we can feel the suspense just as they did
- Make sure the backstory impacts the current scene. Can the reader trust/see that this backstory is relevant to what's about to happen?
- Keep in mind, sometimes the backstory happens too early within the book. Sometimes it's better to tell this backstory when the reader is more invested into the character. Think of how Breaking Bad tells Mike's backstory so much farther after his first presence in the show. >> Also Sonny's Blues does this!!
