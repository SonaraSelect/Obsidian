# Brandon's Philosophy on Plotâ€”Promises, Progress, and Payoffs

## Brandon's Plotting Method

- **Promises, Progress, Payoff**
	- Promises, progress along that promise, and payoff
	- Progress is the most important!
	- Promise is where most things go wrong

>"Quickly give readers promises about what type of story this is, and why it's going to be enjoyable"

**TYPES OF PROMISES**
- Tone
	- Is it going to be whimsical? Humorous? Adventuresome?
- Genre
- Plot - the type of progress that's gonna happen
- Character

>"I'm gonna give you this expected thing but it's gonna be better than you expect

- && With improper promises, the progress feels like a side quest; Unrelated

### Star Wars: A New Hope - Promises
- Little ship vs big ship
- Travel plot - go to a place, find a person
- Character promise - Luke wants an adventure
	- Expanded: Learn the force
- Character promise - Han is mean but cool. What if he wasn't mean
&& Note how everything relates back to little ship vs big ship

\[Little vs Big \[Travel plot \[Character Plot] Travel end] Little vs Big ends ]
- Character moments happen in service of achieving your main goal

**Identify Progress you want to make, then make promises in the appropriate order**

## Approaching writing?
- Outline backwards: **What payoffs do I want to earn?**
