*a novel*

"All my characters are me *to a certain extent*."
- Sometimes she isn't the characters, sometime she is

Where does inspiration comes from
- It's not really something that can be explained. >>Uses phone instead of notebook. Constantly watching the world and writing down little things she notices. The color of a woman's lipstick, or watching the way families say goodbye and the way they show love and longing, etc.
- A lot of people romanticize where inspiration comes from
- I don't choose stories. Stories choose me. I just get drawn to something

What is the belief that you hold about yourself that helps you spur and evelop creativity?
- "I try not to psychoanalyze myself."
- "What books do you want to copy?" --> I don't want to entirely understand my motivations. I would lose something then. Writing is about a discovery. 
- I write because I have to. I love it so much I don't know if I could live without it.
- When the writing doesn't go well, I take a break- the world isnt gonna end- just go read a book it'll come back

What place do you think science fiction has in the african market?
- Write what you want to write! Don't think about there being room for you in the market.

What are your motivations when writing about mental health in african diaspora? Felt responsibilities?
- I suffer from depression. Lowkey I wanted to terrify all immigrant parents who raised their kids in the US and dismissed depression and allat.

Do you work on one story at a time or do you juggle?
- (It's perfectly normal for your children to juggle and never finish; get stuck)
- There are stories that have taken me years, I start but don't know where to go and then leave it alone, starting something else in the mean time.
- When I start a novel I stay in it and get fully immersed. I may take breaks but that's the sole project
- Not every novel you start has to be finished

Something about religion
- Thing in nigerian religionality that causes problems. Started in late 1980s and has taken over thinks. This school of thought has serious consequences, people will cheat and steal and not study for exams, get sick and ditch the hospital, all in the name of the lord. This level of rationality has so many consequences.
- Faith can be a force for god, but it isn't always. The current level of religionality worries me. Popular christianity equates wealth with blessing

What's your greatest obstacle?
- Can't really say. I would still be writing no matter what.
- Obstacles is just when the writing isn't going well. I overcome by reading shopping online, watching youtube videos online. Being a public person can be hard

\>>> noticing that writing about minority/marginalized struggles; even very minor things that dont seem novel can be world changing for people who dont live that experience

When you start a story do you know the ending? Do you have a vision of the ending?
- No. I have a vague idea but I never quite know. Sometimes things go in a new direction and sometimes I have to step in as an author.
