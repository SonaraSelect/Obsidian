## Ambiguity

> Every reader will bring their own experiences, their own vocabulary into... to every word you write... \[when you mention a dog, readers will think of greyhounds, chihuahuas, whatever is specific to them]... The poet's task is not to fight this inherent ambiguity, but to embrace it.

[[How poems cause emotions]]

Poems are not direct ideas. Instead, they use ambiguity in the way that they play with the reader's interpretations. Poems are meant to guide the reader's thoughts into some specific experience, and to do this they must be vague. In order to create any sort of feeling in the reader, the reader must interact with the information at hand and bring forth their own experiences in order to feel something.

In this way, poems must be some level of ambiguous as the effort (ideally mostly unconscious effort) is what allows the reader to form any sort of emotional attachment with the poem.

>Language is not the same as experience.

Poems must understand that they have limits. They cannot convey everything; It's only language after all, and through understanding what ambiguity means here, we can understand that poems can only invoke feelings based on what the reader has already felt. I like to think the limited scope of the reader being the bottleneck here. It's precisely because 'language isn't experience' that poems have to be ambiguous.
## Clarity 

>Clarity works not against ambiguity but hand in hand with it.

This is following along on the idea in [[how poems cause emotions]]; Poem's need a direct focus and center of attention in order to be meaningful, or else the reader does not have anything tangible to \[mostly subconsciously] 'put in the work' for.

## [[Metaphor]]



## Concision 

>You measure concision not by word count, but by the value each word brings to the poem.

Concision is about reducing your poem to only the most valuable words. Every word must server an important purpose; No unnecessary repeating of ideas, etc.

>Most often, the poet should simply offer images and ideas and trust that the reader sees the connections between them. (47)
