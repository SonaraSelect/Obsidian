>\[Characters are represented in 4 ways: dialogue, appearance, action, and thought] (44)

>Summary and indirect speech (like narrating thoughts) are often used to get us quickly to the core of the scene. (46)

>\[If dialogue only conveys information, it is too inert to include. Dialogue should always also tell us more about the characters, move the plot forward, etc. Call this **Sloane's Law**] (47)

**Exercise**: take a mini book around with you and when you hear real life dialogue that speaks to you, write it down verbatim. Ask what about this touches you, and try and freewrite a monologue using that flavor of voice.

### Dialogue as action

Queue example of a worried mother talking to radiologist, who's dialogue only makes her more nervous.

>Dialogue is action when it contains the possibility of change. (53)

**Getting stuck in a repetitive 'yes you are, no im not':** remember that people will change their tactics!

### Text and Subtext

Remember, people who are in extreme emotional states have the least ability to communicate (54).

>"A line of dialogue should always give the impression that more could've been said." -Anton Chekhov (54)

^^^ This relates to piece of advice "I always make sure my characters keep a secret throughout every interaction"

### "No" Dialogue

>"Details are the rocks characters throw at each other \[in conflict dialogue]" -Stephen Fischer (57)

Use arguments and conflict dialogue as an opportunity to tell more details about the characters lives, thoughts, and motivations.

### Format and Style

Thoughts aren't in quotes, spoken lines are. New line for new character talking.

If it's clear who's speaking without a dialogue tag, don't use one at all.

### Dialogue tips
- Is the dialogue better direct, indirect, or summarized?
- Only use monologues when absolutely necessary. Short exchanges are best.
- Always make sure your dialogue is doing 2+ things at a time
- Keep dialogue related to the themes and general story
- Keep exposition out of dialogue (disagree, just be clever)
- Dialogue is more interesting when there's conflict
- Be eager to end dialogue between characters with some things being left unsaid
- **Allow your characters to contradict themselves if need be**
- **Use actions over adverb to indicate character feelings**
- Vernacular is better done through word choice than spelling (think of Blood Meridian)

 **Read your dialogue out loud to make sure it's comfortable to the ear**

### Appearance

Stylize your characters! Let everything about them represent the ideas they embody!

Remember the difference between *movement* and *action*. One is just something the character does, another is something that moves the plot forward
