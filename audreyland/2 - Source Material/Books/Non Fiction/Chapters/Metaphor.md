**tenor** is the original subject.
**vehicle** is the metaphorical object

>Poems are always about at least two things and metaphor is a big part of how you access those layers of meaning.

I would like to extend that metaphor is also how you utilize ambiguity to help the reader understand the emotions of the poem.

### Metaphor as a Figure of Speech

Saying it's something else (as a figure of speech). This is often used to better describe what the object looks like.

>\[Metaphor is creating] analogies between two unlike things using comparative words without using like or as.

### Metaphor as Representation

When the poem talks about a metaphorical object that is meant to represent a certain quality of the object being represented. This is used to explore shared meanings between the metaphor and object.

### Metaphor as Transformation

>\[Hearing or saying flashlight is neurologically similar to holding one in your hand].

Metaphors can help imply direct experience to the reader.

>But in a metaphor \[as opposed to simile], the two sides carry equal or near-equal weight.
>...Metaphor is 'an exchange of energy.'

The best metaphors place equal importance on both objects. This means that the tenor and vehicle must both have purposes in the poem, and beyond that their relationship should be something new and not commonly known or noticed, that tells the reader something they may not have known or understood as clearly before.

### Metaphor at work

>\[Hypothetical poem about prepping for a date then being about a soldier getting ready for war].

this makes for a shallow poem because the vehicle exists only to cover up the meaning. There is no exchange or equal importance.

Keep a thematic consistency between your metaphors per poem

### Metaphor and the Reader

>...readers tend to read past \[predictable metaphors] because the cliche doesn't say anything the reader doesn't already know.

Again, what makes metaphors interesting is the ability to attach two things that are not exactly alike through some shared meaning that expands on both sides. The best metaphors make readers think in new and interesting ways in order to better understand and interact with an idea.
