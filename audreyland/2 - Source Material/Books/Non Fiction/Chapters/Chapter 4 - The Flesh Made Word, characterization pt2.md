# Indirect Characterization

## Authorial Presentation

Great for exposition!
- When the narrator kind of just tells you about the characters, their past, etc. Good because you can cover a lot of ground quickly with time skips and out-of-order recollections
- BUT it **distances the reader** since it's abstractions and generalizations

## Interpretation by Another Character

- yup
# Conflict Between Methods of Presentation

- A character who is elegant, smart, and confident with no weakness is boring. Burroway then gives us a lot of examples where the outward and inward parts of a character are opposites. How are the characters forced to do things they suck at ?
- What makes characters interesting at their core is self betrayal. Basically enneagram
- Take a terrible situation. How would different types of characters react? Think about their backstory, what happened to them earlier; Narrow down their reaction as much as you can

# Credibility

- Like above, the characters have backstories and these should heavily influence everything they say. Let the way they act remind you of their backstory, and **keep it consistent**. If a character is this thing, they will probably do these things, stick to it **Characters should ooze and imply their information**

>"Credibility exists as the combination of appropriateness and specificity" (86)

# Purpose

- idk characters should have a purpose ig

# Complexity

- You're only working at full power when you're drawing upon self experience, observed experience, and imagination to craft your character's experiences

# Change

>"A story is about a single moment in a character's life when a definitive choice is made, after which nothing is the same." (91)

# Reinventing Character

- When drawing directly upon real life people, change something drastic about them! Make them really different so when you have to write about them, you're forced to 're-see' them through a new lens, making you more attentive to how they actually work!
- When writing about what you don't know, draw upon what you do know
- "I tried to draw upon my direct experience to describe something, but **to make it the character's experience**, I had to change details"

# Creating Groups or Crowds

- LIGHT details on EVERYONE at first. THEN zone in.
- Simple sentences to describe people, they were doing this, these two doing this. He, this.

# The Character Journal

- Try making a character journal of real people, random and known. Keep track of how they all move and talk; what makes them unique
