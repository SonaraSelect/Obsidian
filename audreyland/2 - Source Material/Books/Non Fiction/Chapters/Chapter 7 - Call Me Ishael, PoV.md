- **Cool exercise idea:** third person perspective where the real topic at hand is never mentioned, and it's only insinuated, like Hemingway and the short story about the woman regretting her abortion
- **Mystery story inspo:** a mystery story where the characters can be aware that they're being watched maybe? Or at the very least they're plotting to fool the omniscient narrator
# Who Speaks?

## Third Person

- Closed

 **OMNISCIENT**
- Objectively report the action of the story
- Go into the mind of any character
- Interpret for us that character's appearance, speech, actions, and thoughts, even if the character cannot do so
- Move freely in time or space to give us a panoramic, telescopic, microscopic, or historical view, telling us what has happened elsewhere or in the past or what will happen in the future
- Provide general reflections, judgements, and truths (he said he was worried, but he really wasn't)


## Second Person

- Experimental
## First Person

- Personal
# To Whom?

## The Reader

- When another character is narrating (first person) a story about another character, **it's critical that, by the end, the narrator gets changed by the person they are telling the story about**
## Another Character

- **Epistolary novel**: Story consists of notes between characters
## The Self

- Like the writing is a diary, journal; Not expected to be read by anyone
-  Also think interior monologue coming in here and there
# In What Form?

- Is the story generalized, written, spoken or confessional, does it use reportage, confessional, interior monologue, stream of consciousness
# At What Distance?

- Is it an older narrator telling the story of a younger self?
- Authorial/psychic distance - does the language distance us, as readers, from the emotions of the characters?
- Moral distance (unreliable narrator) - is the narration trying to force us to love one character and hate another?
## Distance and the Author-Reader Relationship

- You DON'T want author-reader distance (eg they misunderstand your intent with a character)
- **PoV and Plot and Theme usually just come in on their own after a few drafts. Don't think too hard about it**
# Consistency: A Caution

- "Once you have been stuck in the mind of James Lordly for five pages, you violate the contract by suddenly jumping into Mrs. Grumms' mind"
# A Word about Appropriation

- "We need to imagine each other"
