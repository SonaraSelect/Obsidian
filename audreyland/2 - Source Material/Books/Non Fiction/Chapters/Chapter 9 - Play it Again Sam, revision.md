"Here is where the job gets done, where the crucial struggle is fought. And no one can do it for you." (201)
# Re-Vision

- This is the most dreaded process. You'll be unhappy until it's right.
- Story gets improved by taking risks with structure and being open to new meaning itself
  The part you have to toss most is not only the best-written part, but also the part which was supposed to be the very point
## Worry it and Walk Away

- Time to turn on your inner critic
## Criticism and the Workshop

- Don't fully listen to the reader's suggestions on "why not do this," they don't really know your vision of the story. Instead pay most attention to "I don't believe this; I don't follow this; I don't understand this"
- 206-207 has great ways to interpret what readers actually mean when they say common things
## Revision Questions

- "Why should the reader turn from the first page to the second?" Does the first page introduce real tension?
- Don't just retype, that'll leave you with "patchwork" revisions. Go in with new plans and make room for spontaneous changes too!
- Write 2 or 3 revisions, each focusing on a specific issue
- Remember this is about starting real conflict. Don't let your conflict avoidance instincts get in the way, the characters will have to defend themselves, etc.
- **On those places you refuse to go:** Is this choice right for the story, or are you simply following your comfortable habits

### Revision checklist
- ***Is there unnecessary summary?*** How much can be instead conveyed through dialogue, dress or gesture, or a brief thought
- ***Is it original?*** is the character a stereotype, the emotion too easy? don't let these inert choices stick
- ***Is it clear?*** Where are we, when are we, who are they, how do things look, what time of day or night is it, whats the weather, what's happening?
- ***Is it self conscious?*** Are you having more fun writing than the reader will reading? Just tell the story. It's own style will follow
- ***Where is too long?*** Almost everyone writes too long. "hit it and get out"
- ***Are there too many scenes?*** use as few scenes as possible
- ***Is the language fresh?*** Is there a way to sharpen the dialogue? Are the characters alive? Could they be a little brighter, darker, more present to us?
- ***Where is the story underdeveloped in character, action, and theme?*** What information is missing? What actions incomplete? What images in-exact? Where does the action occur so abruptly it loses emotional force? Is the crisis presented as a scene?
- ***Where is it too general?*** Clarity can be well achieved through careful use of significant detail. Are you using any someones, anythings, huge, handsome, very, or reallys in the story? Seek the particular thing with a particular size and exact degree
