You should always use your setting to your advantage by some degree !! Always !

# Atmosphere: Time Place and Mood

## Harmony and Conflict between Character and Setting

- Are the character's emotions in harmony with the setting? Does the setting resonate with how they feel, or does it aggravate them; make things worse?
## Symbolic Place

- The setting can be a manifestation of the theme! Thematic things can be happening in the background! Though this is hard to access well as a beginning writer

# Some Aspects of Narrative Time

- Your pacing should speed up and slow down

## Summary and Scene

- Example of scene summary spending a paragraph summarizing the weather over a month before zoning in on a specific afternoon
- **Sequential summary** everything happening in order
- **Circumstantial summary** more lyrical(?)

## White Space

- Sometimes it's better to just do a cut-to. If you feel bored filling in the blank, just leave it blank

## Flashback

- Often a summary or dialogue is a better option than doing a full flashback
- If you are tempted to use flashback to fill in a character's whole past, try freewriting everything you can think of really quickly and then decide the smallest amount you can sensibly include in the story. How much is necessary? How much can the reader deduce?
- **Flashback is meant to reveal something from the past at the right time**
You can transition into flashbacks by:
- "guy did yadayadaya. Joe had done that once, when ...."
- \>That time was like when this

- When starting a flashback use past perfect ~3 times before switching to normal past tense. He had blanked, where he had blanked, and then he had said blank
- After it's done remind readers with something that would only happen in the present

## Slow Motion

- Think of it like passionately making out with the scene. You slow down because you're describing so much
