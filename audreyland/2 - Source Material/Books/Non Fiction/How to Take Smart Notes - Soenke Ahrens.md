# How to Take Smart Notes - Soenke Ahrens

A guide to taking good notes in the modern era. Written within the decade, and is aware of software. Highlights the Zettelkasten approach

## Introduction

>"Getting something that is already written into another written piece is incomparably easier than assembling everything in your mind and then trying to retrieve it from there" (Ahrens 6)

This style of notetaking is all about understanding everything first. You want to craft a holistic view of the knowledge and how it connects before starting to approach the essay itself.

## 1 - Everything you need to know

Ahren talks a lot about how the linear note-taking fashion is limiting and inflexible, and scarcely encourages learning past what courses require in university.
